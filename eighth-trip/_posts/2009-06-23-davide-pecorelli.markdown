<p>Davide studies Political Science in Milan and is a journalist. He has worked in the journalism since he was 20 years old. Before going to live in Turin, he wrote for a local journal near Milan; now he works for Narcomafie, a magazine distributed throughout Italy.</p>
<p>He has lived in San Sebastiano da Po since last year to participate with three other people in the project for the social re-use of mafia property. The house where he lives is a property confiscated from Belfiore's family, a powerful Piedmontese clan. One of the inhabitants of this house was Domenico Belfiore, a boss of the 'ndrangheta who was condemned to life imprisonment as the instigater of the murder of Bruno Caccia, a judge killed in 1983.</p>
<p>He says, "For my activity in magazine and social work, it is very important to participate in the Free Gaza trip. Libera, Acmos, and Narcomafie believe in the value of non-violent resistance, the respect of human rights, democracy, equality peace and freedom."</p>
