<p>Cynthia is a former U.S. Congresswoman from Georgia, serving 12 years, and the 2008 Green Party presidential candidate. She was on board the DIGNITY as it was rammed by the Israeli Navy in international waters while passengers were on their way to the occupied people of Gaza.</p>
<p>"The Israelis violated international law by ramming my boat carrying medical supplies to Gaza.  Therefore, I never got to Gaza.  Especially after Operation Cast Lead, I want to go to Gaza, and if I'm lucky, one day, I'll also get to visit a free Palestine," said former Representative Cynthia McKinney, one of the passengers coming back.</p>
