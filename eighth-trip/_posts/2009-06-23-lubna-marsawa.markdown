<p>Lubna is a Palestinian living in Israel. She is a political dynamic activist in Jerusalem working for the Alternative Information Center and Al Quds University. She chooses struggle as her way against the occupation. She believes that activists should take the authority to change the reality and not wait for someone else to do it. It\'s important for her as a Palestinian from 1948 to break the siege and keep the relationship with her people.</p>
