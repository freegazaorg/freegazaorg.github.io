58, US, Captain
<p>John has been a licensed captain since 1978 and has crewed on board ships since he was 12. He is qualified to captain anything from a charter vessels to whale excursion ships to research vessels. He was the Captain of the Free Gaza during the first voyage in August, 2008, and, like so many of us... has Gaza Fever.</p>
<p>He has an extensive background in maritime industry and came up through the chain of work from deck hand to seat-of-your-pants navigation to full-time Captain. He is a hands-on expert with almost any kind of boat.</p>
