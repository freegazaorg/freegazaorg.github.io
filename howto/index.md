## How to edit pages

here if you scroll down you can edit the website `pages`, basically
anything which is not a news item, for example `index.md` is the
homepage, click to edit, then click `Save` button on the right when
you are done.

## How to edit old posts

* click on the `_posts` folder to get to the list of all website news items
* filter them by writing partially the title

## How to create new post

* click on the `_posts` folder
* click on the green `New file` button
* change the filename to the title of your article (NO SPACES, KEEP THE DATESTAMP)
* make sure the filename still ends in .md (it means markdown, it is the file format)
* read instructions in the (?) button if you need help with formatting
* save with the diskette icon on the right

## How to add images

The system is a little buggy for images, it should work on Chrome.

* Open the post you want to add an image to
* First save any other change you made to the text with the diskette icon
* Now drag and drop the image into the page (images should be below 500KB)
* Now the page freezes, but it should be uploading it
* Wait 5 seconds for the upload to complete, then click RELOAD (F5), even if
a warning pops up, go ahead
* You should find that this was added to the page: `[](/images/yourimage.jpg)`
* Save the post again with the diskette button
