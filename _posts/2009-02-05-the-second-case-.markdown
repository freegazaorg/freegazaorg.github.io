English and German, see <a href="http://www.anis-online.de/1/essays/23.htm">http://www.anis-online.de/1/essays/23.htm</a>Â Summary: This essay is about Gaza and the German silence between 1945 and 1968, about Israel's myths and the situation of the Palestinians who are labeled with negative stereotypes, while Jews are labeled with positive stereotypes. The Gaza pogrom was carried out with the participation of German desk-perpetrators and this would be the pure form of racism, emerging from the middle of society. Is it really possible after the Gaza murder to say that this is not even comparable to Germany in 1938? Do we have to say it only is no holocaust YET? What does Israel want to do with the people of Gaza?
