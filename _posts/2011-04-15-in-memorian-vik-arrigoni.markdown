As word has come that Vittorio Arrigoni was murdered in Gaza, those of us who knew and loved him are heartsick. Much will be written ab<img style="border: thick solid black; float: right;" alt="Picture_3" src="images/stories/news/Picture_3.png" height="370" width="278" />out this brave and funny man, the man who always said "Stay Human" at the end of every conversation. His work will continue, but there is a hole in the hearts of all of us. <br style="clear: right;" />
