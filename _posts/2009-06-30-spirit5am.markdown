Dear Friends,<br /><br />We just spoke again with our people aboard the Spirit of Humanity. The Israeli Navy is continuing to try and intimidate the ship, and is actively jamming its radar, GPS, and navigation systems in direct violation of international maritime law. This jamming is extremely dangerous and directly threatens the welfare and safety of everyone aboard our civilian ship.<br /><br />Because their instrumentation is being jammed, they are using compass & paper to attempt to navigate. They are in international waters & they believe their location is approximately 110km off of the town of Hadera. Everyone is tired but determined. They are not being deterred by the Israeli aggression & are continuing toward Gaza. Please help them.<br /><br />Please CALL or FAX Major Liebovitz from the Israeli Navy at:<br />Tel + 972 5 781 86248 or +972 3737 7777 or +972 3737 6242<br />Fax +972 3737 6123 or +972 3737 7175<br /><br />CALL Mark Regev in the Prime Minister's office at:<br />Tel +972 2670 5354 or +972 5 0620 3264<br />mark.regev@it.pmo.gov.il<br /><br />CALL Shlomo Dror in the Ministry of Defence at:<br />Tel +972 3697 5339 or +972 50629 8148<br />mediasar@mod.gov.il<br /><br />-----<br />Free Gaza Movement<br />357 99 081 767<br />www.freegaza.org<br />www.flickr.com/photos/29205195@N02/
