<p>(19.07.08) Bethlehem - Ma'an - A small shipping vessel will set sail for Gaza from Cyprus on 5 August expecting to be illegally detained as it enters Gazan waters. The waters off the Gaza Strip are patrolled by Israeli naval vessels, and Israel enforces a &quot;Fishing Limit&quot; that is 6 nautical miles (11.1 km) from the Gaza shore. These restrictions on access and borders are enforced despite the 2005 Israeli &quot;disengagement&quot; from the Gaza Strip. There will be 60 people aboard the &quot;Free Gaza&quot; vessel including a Holocaust survivor, a survivor of the Palestinian Nakba, and members of the international Palestinian diaspora.
