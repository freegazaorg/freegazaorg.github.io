 We, the Undersigned, call on the United Nations to demand that the State of Israel end its crippling blockade of Gaza or face sanctions.[Petition]( http://tinyurl.com/ofk3qgm for the petition)

    Smaller than Dublin, Ireland, Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth. 80% of its nearly 2 million residents are refugees from other parts of Israel-Palestine who were expelled from their homes in 1948 and 1967, making it the world's largest refugee camp.

    The eight-year siege has sealed Gaza off from the world by land, air and sea, forbidding entry of desperately needed medical supplies, reconstruction materials, and such other goods as toys, crayons, books, candles, matches, fishing rods, baby formula, chocolate, pasta, coffee, shampoo, sheets, donkeys and cows. 90% of the water is undrinkable and water is expected to run out entirely by 2020.

    This siege, which Israel does not formally acknowledge, is illegal.  It devastates the Gazan economy, impedes reconstruction from past bombings, separates families, prevents students from studying abroad, and hurts fishermen and farmers, who cannot pursue their livelihoods near the Buffer Zone without risk of being shot.  It denies Gazans' legal right to live in peace, freedom and dignity, to resist military occupation, and to flee when attacked, as many of them once did to arrive in Gaza.

    For these and many other reasons, we call on the UN to pass a resolution urging all members to impose economic and political sanctions on Israel until it lifts the siege and gives the people of Gaza the chance to live a normal life.
