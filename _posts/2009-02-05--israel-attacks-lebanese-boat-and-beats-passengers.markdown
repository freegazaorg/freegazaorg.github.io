One of the Free Gaza volunteers was on this boat, the TALI, and Free Gaza organizers helped in Cyprus to get the boat inspected, then sent on to Gaza. Please make your outrage heard as, once again, Israel, the bully of the Eastern Mediterranean, gets away with piracy. On board was an elderly patriarch from Jerusalem as well as several Lebanese human rights watchers. According to eye witnesses, the passengers were beaten and much of the boat destroyed. We are checking the status of the units of plasma loaded on board, because, if the stories are accurate that the Israeli Navy thugs turned off the generators, this badly-needed plasma will be destroyed very quickly. You can follow the story in Al Jazeera English and Al Jazeera Arabic.Â  <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/02/20092592757311355.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/02/20092592757311355.html</span></span></a>
