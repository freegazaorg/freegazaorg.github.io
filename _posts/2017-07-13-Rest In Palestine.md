Darlene Wallach was a determined and unwavering activist for Palestine (and for marginalized people around the world). She died this afternoon, July 12, 2017, after a two-year battle with cancer. She was an indomitable fighter for justice in Palestine, and she will be sorely missed by the Palestinians of Gaza and by those of us who knew her.


In August 2008, she was on our first boat to dock in Gaza, US Liberty, where she handled most of the communications and was a crewmember. No task was too impossible for her, and she volunteered for anything that needed to be done. When we arrived on August 23, 2008, she was one of the most joyous of all of us. She stayed in Gaza for several months working with the fishermen there.


In a Nov. 21, 2008 article titled, Activist from San Jose jailed in Israel, Patrick May, a writer for the San Jose Mercury News wrote,


> San Jose substitute teacher and human-rights activist Darlene Wallach is in international hot water again, imprisoned in Israel after being arrested this week on a fishing trawler off the coast of the disputed Gaza Strip.

> In her second arrest by Israelis since 2002, Wallach was picked up along with two fellow members of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), acting as self-described “international observers” on behalf of Palestinians. Fifteen fishermen also detained Tuesday morning have been released, according to Donna Wallach, Darlene’s twin sister who arrived with her in Gaza City by boat in August. She said the three activists have been placed in isolation cells at a prison near Tel Aviv and have gone on a hunger strike to secure the release of the three confiscated fishing trawlers.

> In a statement, the activists said they were fishing in Gaza waters seven miles off the coast of Deir el-Balah, in what they claim is a zone authorized for Palestinian fisherman by the Oslo agreements of 1993 and 1994. They said they were “abducted at gunpoint by Israeli frogmen and taken to Israel.”



When she returned to the US with her twin sister, Donna, they embarked on a lengthy tour of the Bay area, speaking about their experiences during the five months they worked for the ISM, informing audiences with their stories and photos. In that presentation, they were shocking us with the truth about the brutal way the people of Gaza are treated by the Israelis.

Audiences were stunned by the horror of the video that Darlene took of a Gaza fishing boat being attacked by a water cannon. She kept the camera rolling up on deck, although the continuous  stream of water that was smashing the windows of the cabin could have killed her. Darlene was completely fearless, and her own safety took a back seat when it came to documenting (capturing) Israeli atrocities on video. It's one of the most powerful videos anyone has ever seen.


Rest In Palestine, dear Darlene.
