<p>For any of you who get Al Jazeera Mubasher (it's the second channel for Al Jazeera that is not live), our interview will be on at 6 pm Qatar time (same time as Cyprus, 10 hours ahead of California, 7 hours ahead of the East Coast, 2 hours ahead of most of Europe, 3 hours ahead of the UK).<br /> <br />The press conference announces our trip on Thursday to Gaza and includes Cynthia McKinney, Huwaida Arraf and Greta Berlin. Huwaida did a brilliant job of translating Cynthia and my answers.</p>
