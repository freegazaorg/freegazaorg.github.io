     What this Haaretz article does not cover is one of the reasons this case was reopened. Many of you who had been on the DIGNITY and SPIRIT OF HUMANITY voyages in December 2008, January 2009 and July 2009 filled out the ICC forms stating that what Israel did was not a one-off attack on Freedom Flotilla I. Free Gaza board members, Audrey Bomse and Greta Berlin, along with the lawyers from the UK, put all of these testimonies together and sent them to the law offices in the UK who then filed them with the ICC.

     So, thanks to all of our passengers on those three trips who took the time to fill out these LONG legal forms (which had to be in a certain format with ONLY the facts without any subjective comments). All in all, we ended up with over a dozen of these forms from passengers on the other three voyages... setting out a chain of violence rather than just the one time incident.
