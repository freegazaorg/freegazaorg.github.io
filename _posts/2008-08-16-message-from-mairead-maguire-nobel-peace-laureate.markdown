Dear Gaza friends,<br />&nbsp; Your courage and commitment to attempting to break the siege of Gaza and<br />the collective punishment and suffering of the people of Gaza, is truly<br />inspiring and will give hope not only to the people of Gaza but all freedom<br />loving people around the world.<br />&nbsp; Human rights, International Laws and the simply humanitarian law of fair<br />play, must be upheld by all Governments, including Israel, otherwise we<br />create a world of injustice and cruelty. &nbsp;Millions of people around the<br />world are with you all in spirit and wish that you take the love and good<br />wishes to the people of Gaza from us all, to let them know we care about<br />them and are with them in spirit.<br />&nbsp;God Bless your journey and grant you all a safe and successful pilgrimage<br />of justice and peace to the people of Gaza.<br /><br />Salaam, Shalom, Peace,<br />Mairead Maguire<br />Nobel Peace Laureate<p><a href=""></a></p>
