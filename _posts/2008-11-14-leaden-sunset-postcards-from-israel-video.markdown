<p>Video:<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmirsCuUc88" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmirsCuUc88</a></p><p>Leaden sunsets<br />lethal postcards<br />sent from Israel to the fishermen in Gaza.</p><p>Stamped by zionism, they brand the guardians of human rights with stamps of antisemitism.</p><p>The postman in these waters is armour-plated and covered in hatred,<br />the mailboxes look more like floating coffins.</p><p>I've never seen sunsets as crimson as those offshore from the Gaza coast.</p><p>***<br />We accompany the Palestinian fishermen offshore almost every day.<br />We&rsquo;re attacked by Israeli war ships every time, taking pot-shots at us with their whole arsenal. Lately they&rsquo;ve started firing chemical-biological weapons at us.<br />All this to prevent poor, but dignified people from providing themselves with something to feed their families. </p><p>The &ldquo;civilised world&rsquo;s&rdquo; silence is more deafening than the shots you hear in the short film. </p><p>Vittorio Arrigoni<br />contact in Gaza : guerrillaingaza(at)gmail.com </p><p><a href="Vittorio Arrigoni">Vittorio Arrigoni</a></p>
