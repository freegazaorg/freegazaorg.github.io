On August 28, 2008, our two small boats left Gaza. In all the planning we’d done before leaving for Gaza, we never thought to plan what we’d do if we arrived. We never had to worry, for Palestinian hospitality overwhelmed us. 

Our 6 days were filled with opportunities to visit hospitals, Rachel Corrie’s memorial site, speak at Universities, visit a brand-new museum… and eat. Oh, how we ate. And we watched theatre productions, talked to children, and danced, and danced. We were filled with relief that we’d it. Palestinians were filled with joy when we arrived.

This 13-minute video is raw footage of some of the events during the days we were there. There is no narration, just a wash of images set to music. We never thought the scenes would become an archive of what Gaza looked like before Israel destroyed everything. And, we have no idea what’s happened to the children, who are now in their 20s and 30s. Their faces are forever frozen in time.

In the museum segment in the film, we were invited to view a private collection belonging to Jawdat Khoudary. After we left, he opened the "National Museum of Archaeology" for the people of Gaza. And a bit of good news in all the horror and destruction, he had loaned his most precious pieces to Switzerland just before the blockade, so they are in storage there.

We carried 8 Palestinians back to Cyprus that day. And we arrived four more times. But this day, August 28, 2008, will never be forgotten by those of us on the boats and those Palestinians who welcomed us.
