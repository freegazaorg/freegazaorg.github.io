<p>for immediate release<br /> contact: US Boat to Gaza, Robert Naiman, <a href="tel:217-979-2857" value="+12179792857" target="_blank">217-979-2857</a>; <a href="mailto:naiman@justforeignpolicy.org" target="_blank">naiman@justforeignpolicy.org</a><br /> <wbr></wbr>Jane Hirschmann,  <a href="tel:845%20246%206494" value="+18452466494" target="_blank">845 246 6494</a>; <a href="mailto:kaneri46@gmail.com" target="_blank">kaneri46@gmail.com</a><br /> New York, October 20, 6AM EDT<br /><br /> Shortly after 4:00AM EDT, when the Gaza-bound Estelle was in international waters about 30 nautical miles from Gaza, Israeli warships surrounded the Estelle and forcibly boarded and took command of the ship and took its 30 passengers into custody.</p>
<p>Israeli authorities have announced that they are taking the boat and its passengers to the Israeli port of Ashdod. Past experience indicates that the Israeli authorities will likely charge the passengers with attempting to illegally enter Israel, although they were trying to go to Gaza, not Israel.<br /><br /> "The international human rights activists on the Estelle were trying to peacefully sail to Gaza, as is their right," said Jane Hirschmann, an organizer of the U.S. boat to Gaza. "The international community has a profound obligation to speak up against this unjust and illegal action and against the illegal blockade of Gaza's civilian population."</p>
<p>"As Americans, we call on the U.S. government to stop enabling Israeli government violations of international law," said Robert Naiman, Policy Director of Just Foreign Policy and a passenger last year on the U.S. Boat to Gaza, the Audacity of Hope. "If a country which was not a U.S. ally took these actions, the U.S. government would likely be critical. It's time to end this double standard in U.S. policy."</p>
