<div>OJ was one of the passengers and crew members on board the Free Gaza, the first boat to enter the Gaza port in 41 years. She has been a part of other voyages as well. She has gone back to Gaza to work as a volunteer after the latest massacre. Below is her interview from the Palestinian who was injured on 11th January.</div>
<div><br />Jabalia, Gaza Strip The fragile  ceasefire announced on 21st November, following Israel's eight-day  offensive on Gaza, was yet again violated by the Israeli military today  after a fatal attack on a group of Palestinian civilians east of  Jabalia. 19 year-old Anwar Al-Malouk, a law student from the Shajaia  district of Gaza City was shot dead and 21 year-old Omar Wadi from the  Jabalia refugee camp, north of Gaza City, was injured as he came to  Anwar's aid.<br /><br />At about 2.30pm on 11th January, Omar was in a local  cemetary visiting the graves of friends killed under the occupation. He  noticed a group of around 30 Palestinians a few hundred metres away to  the east, between the cemetary and the fence marking the eastern border  of the Gaza Strip.<br /><br />From the cemetary, which was over half a  kilometre from the border fence, Omar approached the group to  investigate the situation. Four Israeli military  jeeps were positioned on the other side of the fence and around 12  Israeli soldiers were present, firing tear-gas canisters towards the  group of Palestinians.<br /><br />At this point, the group was at a distance  of approximately 100 metres from the fence but then fled a further 100  metres back, amid the tear-gas attack. By around 4pm, Anwar had been  separated from the group and remained alone about 40 metres from the  fence, when he was shot by the soldiers and fell.<br /><br />Three of the  group, including Omar, went back to assist Anwar. Omar says he acted  instinctively at the sight of a fellow Palestinian in danger and didn't  consider his own safety - despite not having previously known Anwar. As  he arrived to where Anwar lay, he was hit in both legs by shrapnel from a  hollow-tip bullet which exploded on impact with the ground nearby and  showered metal fragments in his direction.<br /><br />The two others managed  to evacuate Omar and Anwar from the scene to  safety, but Anwar had sustained a serious gunshot wound to his abdomen  and died en route to hospital. Anwar had to be driven from the area to  the main road in a toc-toc, where he was then transferred to an  ambulance. Unfortunately, by this time he had already passed away in the  toc-toc.<br /><br />At Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia, Omar was treated  for ankle injuries. He has since been released, but the shrapnel remains  embedded in his bones. As an outpatient of the osteological department,  he must return next week for assessment regarding the possibility of  surgery to remove the shrapnel. It is understandable that Omar was  terrified during the attack. He has been traumatised by the experience  and has not been able to sleep due to reliving the memory of it.<br /><br />Omar  has two brothers and six sisters. His 18 year-old brother, Mohammed,  was seriously injured during an Israeli incursion in the east of Jabalia  five years ago when he was only 13 years old.  Mohammed underwent treatment in Egypt for four months and is still  receiving treatment in Gaza to this day. <br /><br />The young mens' father  expressed concern about Omar ever visiting the cemetary again, whilst  their mother said she feared one day all her sons would be killed. The  Wadi family yearn for a genuine ceasefire, yet they anticipated from the  outset that Israel would never respect it. Omar's principal hope is that  Israel's crimes against Palestinians will end.<br /><br />Anwar was the  youngest son of the Al-Malouk family and the only one still living at  home, due to his older brothers being married. His 55 year-old mother  hopes he is now at peace. <br /><br />This is not the first killing since the ceasefire. The first Palestinian killed was also named Anwar. On 23rd November, just two  days into the agreement, Anwar Qudieh was shot dead, this time in the  rural area of Abassan, east of Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza  Strip. <br /><br />There have been numerous Israeli attacks  against Palestinian civilians in Gaza during the ceasefire. One can only imagine the response had it been the other way around.<br /><br />Photos courtesy of Desde Palestina:<br /><a href="http://desde-palestina.blogspot.com/2013/01/omar-wadi.html?m=1" target="_blank">http://desde-palestina.<wbr></wbr>blogspot.com/2013/01/omar-<wbr></wbr>wadi.html?m=1</a></div>
