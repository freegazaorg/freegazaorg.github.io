<p>We, the members of the Free Gaza Movement, regret to announce a delay in our plans to return to Gaza this week.&nbsp; Last month, 44 ordinary people challenged Israel's stranglehold on the Gaza Strip, knowing that ordinary people can help create extraordinary change.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />People said that it could not be done; we did it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />This week 22 of us came to Cyprus to fulfill our promise to return to Gaza.&nbsp; Because our two original boats were not suitable for this trip, we decided to lease or buy a sturdier boat. Unfortunately, every time we thought we reached an agreement with a boat owner, our agreement has fallen through, in part, we believe, due to outside pressure. Though it is a very difficult decision to make, we have decided to temporarily delay our voyage.<br />When we left Gaza at the end of August, we made promises to the people there: we will continue to tell the world that Israel still unjustly occupies Gaza; we will continue to support our friends in Gaza as they work to overcome the brutal policies of the occupation; and we will return to Gaza. These are promises we will keep<br />We will continue to draw attention to the suffering that Israel has imposed on ordinary people just like us, in Gaza. We will continue to support our friends in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory as they work to end Israel's occupation of their land and lives. And, very soon, in the coming weeks, we will return to Gaza. <br />In the meantime we call on countries to live up to their obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention and to take action to challenge Israel's collective punishment of 1.5 million residents of the Gaza Strip. <br />###</p><p>-- <br />Greta Berlin<br />Media Team<br />Free Gaza Movement<br />357 99 08 17 67<br /><a href="http://www.freegaza.org/">www.freegaza.org</a><br /><a href="http://www.anis-online.de/office/events/FreeGazaSong.htm">www.anis-online.de/office/events/FreeGazaSong.htm</a><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29205195@N02/">www.flickr.com/photos/29205195@N02/</a> </p><p><a href=""></a></p>
