<p>‘Spirit of humanity'<br />As long as<br />The people of Palestine<br />Have no liberty, no freedom<br />Those of us with a voice to speak <br />Must speak</p>
<p>As long as<br />The children of Gaza<br />Live in fear of Israeli<br />Bombs and occupation<br />Those of us with a voice to speak<br />Must speak</p>
<p>As long as <br />Six million Palestinian refugees<br />Are deportees around the world<br />Those of us with a voice to speak<br />Must speak</p>
<p>As long as<br />Millions of god's children<br />Are hungry, imprisoned, and without hope<br />Those of us with a voice to speak<br />Must speak</p>
<p>Because it is in speaking <br />We find our liberty, our freedom<br />And no prison bars can take away <br />Our peace, our love<br />Which is the true spirit of humanity</p>
<p>(for Gaza and the Palestinian people)<br />Mairead maguire - nobel peace laureate<br />(in Ramle - Israeli prison)<br />3lst june, 2009</p>
