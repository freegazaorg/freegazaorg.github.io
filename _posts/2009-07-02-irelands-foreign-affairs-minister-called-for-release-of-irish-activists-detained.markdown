"Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister Miche√°l Martin today called for the swift release of two Irish nationals currently detained in Israel following the June 30 seizure of a boat en route to Gaza with humanitarian aid.
<p>The two, Nobel Peace Prize winner Mairead Maguire and Derek Graham, are awaiting deportation following the seizure of vessel The Spirit of Humanity.</p>
<p>In a statement, Minister Martin said his department has been closely following the situation and was in ongoing contact with Israeli authorities.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>"My immediate priority is ensuring the safety and welfare of Ms. Maguire and Mr. Graham and securing their release as soon as possible," the minister said.</p>
<p>"I have been assured by the Israeli authorities that they are both well and are being properly treated. An officer from the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv visited yesterday with Ms. Maguire and Mr. Graham to provide assistance and will endeavour to make a further consular visit today"</p>
<p>"I would again renew my call for the release of Ms. Maguire and Mr. Graham as well as the other nineteen passengers detained on The Spirit of Humanity," he added.</p>
<p>" I would also call upon the Israeli Government to ensure that the humanitarian supplies for the people of Gaza being transported on The Spirit of Humanity are made available as soon as possible to the Palestinian authorities for distribution."</p>
<p>The minister called the current Israeli blockade of Gaza "completely unacceptable" and called for all border crossings into the coastal salient to be opened to humanitarian and commercial traffic."<br /> <br /> http://news.eircom.net/breakingnews/15981751/?view=Standard</p>
