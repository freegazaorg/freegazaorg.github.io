<p>Huwaida Arraf, Chairwoman and one of the passengers on the Freedom Flotilla to Gaza was arrested today by Israeli Border Police at the weekly nonviolent demonstration in Bil'in.  Bilin (http://www.bilin-village.org/english/) is the West Bank village outside of Ramallah, Palestine.</p>
<p>Since January 2005, the village has been organizing weekly nonviolent protests against the construction of the barrier wall which is in effect strangulating the village from the outside world.</p>
<p>Violent responses to the protesters by Israeli border police have been commonplace. For example, last year, a prominent Palestinian activist, Bassem Abu Rahma (http://www.bilin-village.org/english/articles/different-look/His-name-was-Bassem). was killed by a high velocity teargas canister, the same canister that caused 21-year-old American Emily Henochowicz to lose her eye early this week at a similar nonviolent demonstration.</p>
<p>Huwaida is a Palestinian-American from Michigan, and also a citizen of historic Palestine. She is a human rights activist and co-founder of the International Solidarity Movement. In 2007 she received her Juris Doctor from American University in Washington D.C. and from 2007 - 2008 taught Human Rights and Humanitarian Law at Al Quds University in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>No additional information on Arraf is available at this time.</p>
