<p>News of the officers' arrests was first reported by Ynet, which quoted a  high-ranking officer who said, "The investigation has just begun, but  as it appears now it will prove embarrassing and shameful. These are  soldiers who don't understand what their uniform represents."</p>
<p>So the Israeli military, 'the most moral army in the world' is upset over its soldiers stealing our electronic equipment, then selling it to each other and putting it on EBay. They fail to say that these same 'soldiers' murdered nine civilians in the dark of early morning in international waters. In addition, several articles state that no one on board any of these boats made a claim for the laptops. That is patently untrue.</p>
<p>We are continuing to collect data on all of the equipment and money that was stolen from us, and will continue to work with our attorneys.</p>
