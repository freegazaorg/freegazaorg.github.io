<p>The Parliamentarians held a press conference today in Gaza today to talk about what they had seen and heard. The conference was set up well in advance, then scheduled for 2:00 pm to ensure that journalists from Jerusalem would be able to attend. According to our contact in Jerusalem, the journalists all went to the Eretz checkpoint in Israel in plenty of time to cover the press conference.<br /><br />The Israeli government REFUSED them entrance... all of them. For any of you who have press contacts, please let the journalists know what has happened. If you are media in Cyprus, please come to the port tomorrow at 9:00 am to interview the parliamentarians as they disembark.</p><p>Contact: Mary Hughes, Cyprus +357 96 75 00 59<br />Greta Berlin, Cyprus: +357 99 08 17 67<br />Osama Qashoo, +44 78 33 38 16 60<br />Angela Godfrey Goldstein, Jerusalem: +972 547 366 393 <br /></p><p><a href=""></a></p>
