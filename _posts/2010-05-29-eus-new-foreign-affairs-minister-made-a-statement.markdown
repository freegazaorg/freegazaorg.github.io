<p>EUROPEAN UNION Brussels, 28 May 2010</p>
<p>Statement by the spokesperson of<br />High Representative Catherine Ashton<br />on the flotilla sailing to Gaza</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The spokesperson of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice</p>
<p>President of the Commission Catherine Ashton issued a following statement today:</p>
<p>"We strongly urge that all involved act with a sense of restraint and responsibility and work for a</p>
<p>constructive resolution. The EU remains gravely concerned by the humanitarian situation in Gaza.<br />The continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive.</p>
<p>We would like to reiterate the EU's call for an immediate, sustained and unconditional opening of crossings for the flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza."</p>
