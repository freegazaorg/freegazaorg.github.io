<p>December 7, 2012</p>
<p>An  emergency delegation of peace activists, lawyers, and journalists that  hurried to the Gaza Strip just days after the end of Israel’s recent  assault on the territory has wound up up a week of bearing witness both  to the war’s devastation and to the Gazan people’s determination to  rebuild their society and seek a more peaceful and just future.</p>
<p>Consisting  of 20 U.S. citizens, two from the UK, one from Spain, and one from  Germany, and ranging in age from 23 to 82, the group entered the Gaza  Strip through the Rafah crossing from Egypt on Nov. 26 and 27, following  the ceasefire brokered by Egypt and finally announced on Nov. 21. Over  the last week members of the group have traveled throughout the Strip,  meeting with the families of some of the more than 160 people killed,  visiting hospitals and bombed-out homes, joining farmers and fishermen  in their efforts to ensure that the terms of the ceasefire agreement are  implemented fully, and exchanging views with local human-rights  advocates, professors and students, young bloggers, and people on the  streets.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen the  devastating destructiveness of Israel’s high-tech weaponry, most of it  supplied by the U.S. at American taxpayer’s expense,” said Col. Ann  Wright, ret., who served in the U.S. military for 29 years and in the  U.S. diplomatic service for 13. “We’ve heard grief, anger, fear, and  bewilderment, but just about everyone we’ve talked to has also expressed  pride in their society’s resiliency and a commitment to continue the  struggle for their rights, despite the high price they’ve paid.”</p>
<p>“Over  and over people told us terrified they were by the constant buzzing of  the drones, and the bombs and rockets that shook whole neighborhoods and  sent deadly shrapnel over wide areas,” said delegation member Medea  Benjamin, co-founder of CODEPINK. “There was no safe haven in the Gaza  Strip.”</p>
<p>Many of the most  poignant stories delegation members heard involved children killed or  injured in the Israeli attacks. Kathy Kelly, co-coordinator of Voices  for Creative Nonviolence, recalled a family speaking fondly about their  lively and lovable eight-year-old son, Fares. On November 15, 2012,  shrapnel from an Israeli rocket attacks decapitated Fares as he slept.  “He was the life of the house,” said Ahmed Baiyouni, his father. “Now  the home seems so quiet.”</p>
<p>At  least 33 children were killed and 247 wounded during the Israeli  onslaught, according to a preliminary count by the Palestinian Centre  for Human Rights in Gaza. Even children who weren’t harmed physically  were left traumatized by the sights, sounds, and bone-jarring impact of  the bombing, many parents told the visiting delegation. Despite  warning shots fired by Israeli forces, delegation members also  accompanied fishermen and farmers asserting their right to fish in  Gaza’s territorial waters and to farm their lands along the border with  Israel. In recent years Israel unilaterally banned Gaza’s fishing fleet  from sailing more than three nautical miles offshore and declared “no  go” zones in Gazan territory along the border with Israel, including  much of the area’s most productive agricultural land. Israeli forces  enforced these ban with frequent attacks on both farmers and fishermen.</p>
<p>According  to the text of the November 21 ceasefire agreement, this was supposed  to change: Israel’s obligations include “refraining from restricting  residents' free movements and targeting residents in border areas.” With  their rights thus reaffirmed, Gazans all along the border have returned  to land they have been unable to farm for years, while fishermen have  sailed out to six nautical miles offshore. Unfortunately,  since day one of the ceasefire Israel has repeatedly violated its  commitment, firing guns and tear gas across the border at Palestinians  as they farm their own land and sending gunboats to harass the  fishermen. Since the ceasefire Israeli fire along the border fence has  killed one civilian and wounded at least 42, including 7 children, while  Israeli naval forces have arrested at least 29 fishermen, impounded and  damaged nine fishing boats, and destroyed one boat.</p>
<p>"The shooting at farmers and fishermen puts the ceasefire at risk," said attorney James Marc Leas, co-chair of the <a href="http://www.nlginternational.org/com/main.php?cid=11" target="_blank">National Lawyers Guild Free Palestine Sub-committee</a>. "If the ceasefire ends, Israel cannot shift the blame as it is the first to be shooting guns."</p>
<p>The  delegation was in Gaza when the UN General Assembly voted overwhelming  to grant Palestine recognition as an “observer state.” While people  celebrated the vote, many expressed anger that the U.S. joined Israel in  voting “No.” They were even angrier that the U.S. supported the Israeli  attack on Gaza, citing Israel's right to self-defense as if Israel were  the victim and not the aggressor. Jamal Dalu, a shop keeper who lost 11  members of his family, including his wife and five children, told  delegates: "Barack Obama has the blood of my children on his hands,  because he gave Israel the green light to carry out these crimes."</p>
<p>The  group brought medical supplies and donations for the hospitals and the  Red Crescent, and donated funds to some of the families who lost their  homes. But these donations are meager compared to the $3 billion in US  tax dollars going to the Israeli military. The group plans to use their  experiences to report back to their communities and organize to change  US policy. While some members of the  emergency delegation plan to stay longer in Gaza, most have just  returned to their homes and are available for interviews.
