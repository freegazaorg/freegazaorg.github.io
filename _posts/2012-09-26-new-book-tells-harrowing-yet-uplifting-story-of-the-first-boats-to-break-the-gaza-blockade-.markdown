The boats, launched by the                   Free Gaza Movement, were the first international boats                   to land in the port of Gaza in 41 years to breech the                   illegal blockade. <br /> <br /> The Freedom Sailors book launches in Hamilton,                   Toronto, London, Montreal, Ottawa, Nanaimo, and                   Vancouver will also provide updates on the continuing                   efforts to challenge the maritime blockade, including                   the Canadian Boat to Gaza's new project, Gaza's Ark                   <<a href="http://www.gazaark.org/" target="_blank">http://www.gazaark.org/</a>>                   . <br /> <br /> <strong>WHEN & WHERE </strong><br /> <br /> * Hamilton: Friday, September 28 at 3pm.

<br /> ABOUT <strong>GRETA BERLIN</strong> <br /> Greta K. Berlin is a media communications expert, and                   a spokesperson and cofounder of the Free Gaza                   Movement. She was on board the FREE GAZA - the first                   boat with internationals to reach the besieged strip                   of the Mediterranean in 41 years. She has been an                   advocate for justice for Palestinians since the early                   1960s and she has worked for the International                   Solidarity Movement in the West Bank. <br /> <br /> WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT<strong> FREEDOM SAILORS</strong> <br /> "Freedom Sailors is a powerful record of the political                   and humanitarian activity of some of the best humans                   we are ever likely to meet, or learn about. These                   women and men leave us with the most wonderful of                   questions: is human courage and sacrifice the same as                   love? And is it this love for ourselves collectively,                   as humans, that has a chance of saving us and our                   planet? To read this book is to see what we can be                   like, in the face of imminent danger." <br /> - Alice Walker, Earthling poet, writer and activist <br /> <br /> "A riveting account of one of the great moments in the                   history of non-violent resistance: breaking the                   criminal and sadistic siege of Gaza, and letting the                   prisoners know that at least some of the outside world                   care about them and their grim fate. The Free Gaza                   flotillas are truly an inspiration." <br /> - Noam Chomsky, Ph.D. - Professor, MIT <br /> <br /> -30- <br /> <br /> <em>For More Information: </em></span></div>
