<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: black;">Israel and the US outsourced the siege of Gaza to Athens last summer by preventing 8 boats in the Freedom Flotilla 2-Stay Human from sailing from Greek ports to Gaza. Despite this we were able to bring world-wide attention to the blockade of the Gaza Strip. Our efforts in Greece only fueled our determination to challenge the imprisonment of the people of Gaza. We said we would continue to sail and so we are!!!</span><br /> <span style="color: black;"> </span><br /> <span style="color: black;">At this moment, two boats are in international waters in the Mediterranean heading to Gaza.  One boat, the Saoirse from Ireland, includes parliamentarians among its passengers.  The other, the Tahrir, carries representatives from Canada, the U.S., Australia, and Palestine. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: black;">The U.S. Representative on the Tahrir, Kit Kittredge, was a passenger on the U.S. Boat to Gaza, The Audacity of Hope mission in Athens in July.  A journalist from Democracy Now is on the Tahrir also. Civil society organizations in Gaza await their arrival, and look forward to the delivery of letters collected from thousands of U.S. supporters in the To Gaza With Love campaign. </span><br /> <span style="color: black;"> </span><br /> <span style="color: black;">We need your help to make this mission a success. Please take these actions immediately.</span><br /> <span style="color: black;"> </span><br /> <span style="color: black;">1.
