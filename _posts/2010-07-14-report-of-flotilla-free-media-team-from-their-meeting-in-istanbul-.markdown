<p><br /> (Istanbul,Tuesday, July 13th, 2010). It has been 43 days since the bloody  raid carried out by the Israeli army in international waters. During  this raid on the Mavi Marmara nine people, including one journalist,  were killed. We are here today as survivors of that attack, and as  journalists who were not silenced by Israeli bullets. There were about  sixty press members from Turkey and all over the world on those ships,  which departed to carry humanitarian aid to the civlians of Gaza, who  are imprisoned under an illegal Israeli blockade. <br /> <br /> The raid at dawn targeted both journalists and regular civilians. The  press members were confronted with death like everyone else on the ship. <img style="float: left;" alt="34503_421141472763_705077763_4717070_4067780_n" src="images/stories/news/34503_421141472763_705077763_4717070_4067780_n.jpg" height="235" width="355" /> <br /> The soldiers who illegally boarded the ship and opened fire, by order  from the Israeli Ministry of Defence, also prevented us from doing our  job. In fact, they ultimately punished us for doing our job. This is in  clear violation of international law. According to the “International  Instrument for Citizenship and Civil Rights” which has been accepted by  the United Nations since 1966, and the “First Principles Declaration  Regarding the Mass Circulation of Media” which has been prepared by  UNESCO.</p>
<p />This enshrines “the freedom to give information, by journalists”  and forbids “preventing them from collecting information”. Rights which  Israel has clearly violated. <br /><br /><a href="http://solidariosengaza.wordpress.com/2010/07/13/manifiesto-del-grupo-flotilla-free-media-reunido-hoy-en-estambul/">http://solidariosengaza.wordpress.com/2010/07/13/manifiesto-del-grupo-flotilla-free-media-reunido-hoy-en-estambul/</a><br /> <br /> We were faced with an inhumane intervention that was against  international law and in violation of the most basic of human rights.  One of our fellow journalists, Cevdet Kılıçlar, was ruthlessly executed  with a bullet to his forehead while fulfilling his duties as a  journalist. <br /> 

<br /> After the bloody raid was complete, our human dignity was completely  disregarded as we were forced on our knees under the burning sun with  our hands tied behind our backs. It was a harsh violation of our human  rights. Our freedom to collect and keep information was completely  ignored. Live broadcasts and all other forms of communication with the  outside world were disrupted and prevented by the jamming of our  satellite connection. Our computers, cameras, memory cards- in short all  the equipment necessary to do our job- were illegally confiscated, they  were all stolen. The vast majority of these items were not returned.  The few items that were returned have been destroyed deeming them utterly  useless. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, all of our personal belongings- books, clothes,  shoes, and even toothbrushes were also stolen. Some of our money and  passports were forcefully seized and never returned. <br /> <br /> We were arrested at gun-point. They put handcuffs on us. We were  illegally questioned over and over again, as if we were criminals. We  had to endure humiliating body searched, full body searches, in order to  prevent any images from reaching the outside world. Neither our press  credentials, nor our membership to national and international press  associations were acknowledged or respected. We were told several times,  and in the harshest and rudest possible way, that being a member of the  press meant nothing. We were kidnapped and illegally detained in prison  for two days. During this time we were not allowed to communicate with  our press associations, employers or even our families. We were not  given lawyers; in fact many of us never even got councilor assistance  from our government. We could neither receive information from the  outside world, nor send information out. <br /> <br /> Press rights and freedoms that are guaranteed by international  agreements have been disregarded, disrespected and treated with utter  contempt by Israel. The rule of law- one of the shared values of all  humanity- was ignored. We cannot and must not remain silent. Not as  humans, nor as members of the press. We must protect the rights that  have been fought for by so many who sacrificed so much so that we can  benefit from them today. <br /> <br /> Because of this we have established a platform called Flotilla Free  Press (FFP). We will share developments and news about the what happened  to us as journalists on that bloody night, and the steps we are taking  to secure our rights on our website which shares the name. <br /> <br /> We have researched our rights within the framework of international law.  We have initiated action with our journalist friends from all over the  world and are lodging law suites both in our own countries and in  Israel. <br /> <br /> We, as journalists, will follow this process to the end by suing for  psychological and material damages under national and international law  so that the guilty parties in this heinous crime against humanity, this  blotch on the human history, will be punished and brought to justice. <br /> <br /> In accordance with the information that we have received from our  lawyers about the legal status of this action, we consider it beneficial  to share with you our demands from both the United Nations and the  government of Israel: <br /> <br /> 1- There is a prohibition against intercepting boats on the open seas  according to international agreements. Firstly, the event occurred in  international waters that are in the open seas. According to 1958 Geneva  and 1983 the United Nations Admiralty Law Contract open seas means  international waters which are not under the dominion of any state.  There is the principle of the freedom of open seas. The Israeli  government committed a crime in intercepting and boarding our ship in  complete violation of international contracts, treaties and customs.  Those who issued the order to attack, and those who carried out this  raid must be held accountable by independent, international courts. The  decisions resulting from this inquiry and prosecution are expected to be  in accordance with human conscience and first the principles of law. <br /> <br /> 2- Israel violated international laws by seizing our technical  equipment. The Israeli state must immediately return this equipment to  journalists intact. <br /> <br /> 3- The attack on the Freedom Flotilla was an attack against press  freedom. The event must be investigated by an objective, international  commission under the supervision of the United Nations. The Israeli  government must pay compensation to those who have suffered in this  event, including their relatives. <br /> <br /> 4- The Israeli state has used disproportionate force and also ignored UN  laws which prevent the deliberate use of force on journalists and  civilians. <br /> <br /> There were no weapons at all on the ship. On the contrary there was  medicine, food, children’s playground equipment and other similar  humanitarian aid. Most importantly, Israel knew this. The United Nations  must take various actions, including economic sanctions, against  Israel. Both the United Nations and the Security Council must deal with  this situation seriously. This incident must be condemned in the  harshest of terms by the Security Council. <br /> <br /> 5- Equally, international press associations must draft censure  resolutions aimed at the Israeli government, which has prevented  journalists from doing their job. <br /> <br /> We will persist in our demands of the International community. <br /> <br /> We will continue in our struggle to ensure that free media is not  attacked. <br /> <br /> We will continue reporting the truth. <br /> <br /> We will not be silenced. <br /> <br /> With Regards, <br /> <br /> Flotilla Free Press (FFP) Member Journalists</p>
