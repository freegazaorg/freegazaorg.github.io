<p>From DEMOCRACY NOW!</p>
<p>Turkey has downgraded diplomatic ties with Israel and frozen military cooperation ahead of a long-awaited United Nations report on Israel’s deadly attack on a Gaza-bound aid ship in 2010. We speak with Norman Finkelstein, author of several books on the Israel-Palestine conflict, including “‘This Time We Went Too Far’: Truth & Consequences of the Gaza Invasion.” We are also joined by <strong>Huwaida Arraf</strong>, one of the organizers of the <strong>Free Gaza Movement</strong>.</p>
