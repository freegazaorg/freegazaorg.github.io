<p>To: The Israeli Ministry of Defense, Fax: 972-3-697-6717<br />To: The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Fax: 972-2-5303367<br />From: The Free Gaza Movement</p>
<p>This letter serves as a formal notification to you, as the Occupying Power<br />and belligerent force in the Gaza Strip, that on Thursday, June 25, 2009<br />we are navigating the motor vessel Spirit of Humanity, and the motor<br />vessel Free Gaza from the Port of Larnaca to the port of Gaza City.  Our<br />vessels will be flying the Greek flags, and, as such, fall under the<br />jurisdiction Greece.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>We will be sailing from Cypriot waters into international waters, then<br />directly into the territorial waters of the Gaza Strip without entering or<br />nearing Israeli territorial waters.</p>
<p>We will be carrying medical supplies in sealed boxes, as well as crayons,<br />coloring books and toys for children, cleared by customs at the Larnaca<br />International Airport and the Port of Larnaca. We will also be carrying<br />300 bags of cement delivered directly from the supplier to the Port of<br />Larnaca. There will be passengers and crew on board from 14 different<br />countries. Our boats and cargo will have received security clearance from<br />the Port Authorities in Cyprus before we depart.</p>
<p>As it will be confirmed that neither we, the cargo, any of the boats'<br />contents, nor the boats themselves constitute any threat to the security<br />of Israel or its armed forces, we do not expect any interference with our<br />voyage by Israel's authorities.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, December 30, an Israeli Navy vessel violently, and without<br />warning, attacked our motor vessel Dignity, disabling the vessel and<br />endangering the lives of the 16 civilians on board.  This notice serves as<br />clear notification to you of our approach. Any attack on the motor<br />vessels, Spirit of Humanity and/or Free Gaza will be premeditated and any<br />harm inflicted on the people on board will be considered the result of a<br />deliberate attack on unarmed civilians.</p>
<p>A copy of this notification has been sent to the embassies of the<br />civilians who will be on board.</p>
