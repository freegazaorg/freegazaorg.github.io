<h6 data-ft="{"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span data-ft="{">Here is Kevin Neish's story of that  night two years ago, May 31 2010, when Freedom Flotilla 1 was attacked, plus a two-year follow up with IHH. Bravo to him and to everyone on  those ships who were attacked. All six ships were illegally boarded in international waters by Israeli commandos who had commited piracy on the high seas.Â  Many of  our passengers were beaten, their bones broken. Israel attacked all of  our ships, but the passengers on board the Mavi Maramar paid the  ultimate price. </span></span></h6>
