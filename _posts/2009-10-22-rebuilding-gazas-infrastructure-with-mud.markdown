<p>SHEIKH ZAYED, occupied Gaza Strip (IPS) – On a searing summer morning,</p>
<p>workers are adding layers to the mud-brick police station being</p>
<p>constructed in Sheikh Zayed, northern Gaza.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We started building on 20 June,” says Mohammed al-Sheikh Eid, a</p>
<p>consultant engineer with Gaza’s Ministry of Interior. “Since this is</p>
<p>the first time we’ve built something on this scale with mud bricks, we</p>
<p>can’t estimate exactly how much longer it will take to complete. Maybe</p>
<p>another two months or so.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He is confident, however, that they will finish before the winter</p>
<p>rains begin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since the war on Gaza ended, a number of houses have been built using</p>
<p>mud to create simple, square, two or three-room homes. The new Sheikh</p>
<p>Zayed police station is one of the larger and more ambitious projects.</p>
<p />

</p>
<p>An intricate series of thick-walled, deep-arched chambers form what is</p>
<p>on the whole a much more artistic rendition of the former square,</p>
<p>cement police station bombed during the attacks. When finished, the</p>
<p>station will be 550 square meters, including seven 3.5m by 3.5m office</p>
<p>rooms and eight long, arched-roofed chambers 3m wide and 8m long.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast to Gaza’s basic new mud-brick homes, with their cracked-</p>
<p>earth finish inside and rough, straw-flecked outer layer, the police</p>
<p>station design replicates that of the elegant, traditional Palestinian</p>
<p>stone or brick buildings: neatly-packed rows of brick frame windows</p>
<p>and doorways in graceful arcs; with surprisingly smooth domes that top</p>
<p>off vaulted rooms and corridors. The one-level station, with its</p>
<p>multiple rooftop domes, resembles the architecture of Palestinian</p>
<p>homes from Nablus to Jerusalem.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The site, just off the coastal road serving Beit Lahiya, is open and</p>
<p>spacious, with a contrasting backdrop of cement block apartment</p>
<p>buildings, built long before the Israeli siege on Gaza, when cement</p>
<p>was accessible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Engineer and site supervisor Sameh al-Khalout explains the small-scale</p>
<p>and hand-crafted construction process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The mud bricks take between one and two weeks to cast and dry,” he</p>
<p>says, gesturing at the rows of bricks drying in the sun. “Each brick</p>
<p>costs roughly one shekel [a quarter of a dollar] to make.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Al-Khalout says the clay is brought from a nearby area of Beit Lahiya,</p>
<p>and the straw comes from local farmers. “We will put plaster on the</p>
<p>roof, to seal it and protect it from rain.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wood is temporarily used to buffer ceiling arches and windows until</p>
<p>the clay mortar hardens. The wood is then removed and used elsewhere</p>
<p>in the same manner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Apart from these wood bracings, conventional and excessively expensive</p>
<p>building materials are not used.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cement smuggled in via the tunnels between Egypt and Gaza is as much</p>
<p>as ten times the pre-siege price. A ton of cement costs 3,400 shekels</p>
<p>($850), compared to the 350 shekels it cost prior to June 2007.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Husam Toubil from the United Nations Development Programme says Gaza</p>
<p>requires 50,000 tons of cement to rebuild destroyed homes, and 41,000</p>
<p>tons for public buildings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Al-Khalout says problems extend beyond lack of availability of</p>
<p>materials. “For most of our workers, this is their first experience</p>
<p>building with mud bricks.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Since we have to bring in clay, straw and gravel, and mix the mud</p>
<p>cement, make the bricks and then build the actual station, we require</p>
<p>more workers than we would using cement.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In an enclosed Strip where unemployment is near 50 percent and poverty</p>
<p>has reached 90 percent, according to a recent UN Conference on Trade</p>
<p>and Development (UNCATD) report, the workers will brave the heat for</p>
<p>the chance to earn 40 shekels a day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since the siege on Gaza tightened in June 2007, almost no construction</p>
<p>materials have entered Gaza, according to the OCHA report. This is in</p>
<p>comparison to the pre-attacks, pre-siege import levels of 7,400 trucks</p>
<p>per month, from January to May 2007.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>According to the United Nations Relief Web news, 3,900 truckloads</p>
<p>entered Gaza from January to May 2007. Over the same period this year,</p>
<p>six trucks were allowed in. These carried material for water projects,</p>
<p>greatly in need and long awaiting completion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Israeli authorities say the ban on building materials is to</p>
<p>prevent Hamas from using so-called “dual use” items for military</p>
<p>activities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yet, non-Hamas run agencies, schools, and healthcare centers are</p>
<p>facing the same blanket restrictions on import of cement, gravel,</p>
<p>wood, tiles, piping, paint, glass and steel bars, notes the OCHA</p>
<p>report.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The mud brick technique, extended beyond the simple clay ovens</p>
<p>prevalent in Gaza to the building of houses, potentially meets some of</p>
<p>Gaza’s great construction needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>East of Gaza city, in the al-Shejayia district, engineers have tackled</p>
<p>the challenge of a multi-level clay-brick building: a three-story</p>
<p>school for 600 disabled children is under construction, using a</p>
<p>combination of mud brick and rubble from the remains of homes and</p>
<p>buildings destroyed during the Israeli attacks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>According to a Guardian news report, engineer Maher al-Batroukh and</p>
<p>university engineers experimented with clay to create strong bricks.</p>
<p>When finished, the school will be roughly twice the size of the Sheikh</p>
<p>Zayed police station, with similar domed ceilings and plaster coating.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Noting the success of clay building endeavors, the Hamas Ministry of</p>
<p>Public Works is likewise pursuing the mud-brick alternative, with</p>
<p>plans to build multi-story houses and re-build destroyed public</p>
<p>buildings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While some are finding means to get around the Israeli ban on nearly</p>
<p>everything needed to re-build in Gaza, the on-going siege on the Strip</p>
<p>continues to hit daily life to an extent that the latest UN report</p>
<p>notes that closed borders and delays in allowing in goods are</p>
<p>“devastating livelihoods” and causing gradual “de-development.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The OCHA report further cites the damage to education, including</p>
<p>overcrowding due to destroyed or damaged schools, and denied or</p>
<p>delayed education materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In an August 2009 statement, Maxwell Gaylard, the UN Humanitarian</p>
<p>Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, noted that the</p>
<p>“deterioration and breakdown of water and sanitation facilities in</p>
<p>Gaza is compounding an already severe and protracted denial of human</p>
<p>dignity in the Gaza Strip.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gaylard, along with the Association for International Development</p>
<p>Agencies (AIDA), notes that the Israeli denial of entry of equipment</p>
<p>and supplies needed for the construction, maintenance and operation of</p>
<p>water and sanitation facilities since June 2007 has led to “the</p>
<p>gradual deterioration of these essential services.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Further citing destruction from the Israeli attacks, the statement</p>
<p>says Gaza’s sanitation and water services are on the “brink of</p>
<p>collapse,” noting that the sparse supplies allowed in have been</p>
<p>“nowhere near enough to restore a fully functioning water and</p>
<p>sanitation system.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>About 60 percent of the population does not have continuous access to</p>
<p>water, the statement notes. Roughly 10,000 people in Gaza have no</p>
<p>access to the water network at all. This, combined with the 50-80</p>
<p>million liters of untreated and partially treated wastewater that is</p>
<p>being discharged daily since January 2008, compounds the water and</p>
<p>sanitation crisis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although some resourceful individuals have built homes despite the ban</p>
<p>on cement, these various reports highlight that the manifold problems</p>
<p>created by the ongoing siege and Israeli attacks on Gaza are too</p>
<p>extensive to be solved by improvisation and mud alone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) reports that 60 police</p>
<p>stations were destroyed or damaged during the winter 2008-2009 Israeli</p>
<p>attacks on Gaza.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</p>
<p>(OCHA) August 2009 report says more than 6,400 homes were destroyed or</p>
<p>severely damaged, and over 52,000 suffered minor damage from bombing</p>
<p>during Israel’s winter war on Gaza.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The OCHA report notes that the continued Israeli-led siege on Gaza has</p>
<p>prevented reconstruction or repair of 13,900 homes, including</p>
<p>approximately 2,700 homes damaged or destroyed in earlier Israeli</p>
<p>military operations, and of 3,000 housing units intended to replace</p>
<p>inadequate homes in crowded refugee camps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over 20,000 Palestinians remain displaced in Gaza, with approximately</p>
<p>100 families still living in emergency tents provided by aid agencies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PCHR also reports that 215 factories and 700 private businesses, 17</p>
<p>universities or colleges, 15 hospitals and 43 health care centers, and</p>
<p>58 mosques were destroyed or damaged during the attacks. The United</p>
<p>Nations says that 298 schools were destroyed or damaged.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They all await reconstruction, as does Gaza’s shattered economy.</p>
