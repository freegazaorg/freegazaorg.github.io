<p>The Free Gaza movement is working hard to return to Gaza in the fall of 2009. We will return with a cargo ship laden with supplies denied by Israel as well as two to three passenger boats carrying members of Parliament from around the world, human rights observers and journalists. We will not wait for winter. And we will continue to send boats to break Israel's draconian siege of Gaza.</p>
