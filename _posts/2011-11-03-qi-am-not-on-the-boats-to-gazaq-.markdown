November 2, 2011 Mazin Qumsieh<br />Dear friends and colleagues<br /> <br /> This letter was written and rewritten four times as the ups and downs of  the last few days.  When you get it two boats would have left Turkish  waters and I am not on one of them.  I finalize this letter from a boat returning to port in Turkey.  Tears are dry (of joy at success of our  comrads and sadness for not being with them).  The will is still there  and I promise myself to get to Gaza next time.  The boats now in  International waters are named Saoirse (<a href="http://irishshiptogaza.org/" target="_blank">http://irishshiptogaza.org/</a> ) and Tahrir (<a href="http://www.tahrir.ca/" target="_blank">http://www.tahrir.ca</a>),  Irish and Arabic for Liberty and Freedom.  The Canadian steering  committee that invited us to join selected 11 from the 36 slated to go  because they were unfairly reduced to that number by the Turkish harbor  master. <br /> <br />We are very disappointed that 25 of us were left behind.  Some of us left behind are trying different ways to catch up and we may still succeed.  In fact if you do not hear from me in 24 hours it  means most likely I have succeeded to get on a boat. We hope that those  who took the boats do arrive to the besieged strip on the Mediterranean  where 1.6 million people are held under and immoral and illegal  blockade/siege.  A small group of us took a small boat to try to meet  one of the boats in waters off the coast but that did not work out  (Turkish coast guard and timing).  But it felt important to try.<br /> <br /> I personally wanted so bad to visit many friends in Gaza some of them I  have not seen in years.  I wanted to visit Hiam and her family.  I last  saw Hiam and her mother 10 years ago when we brought Hiam to CT (she was  then less than 8 years old) to get a prosthetic eye after she was shot  deliberately by an Israeli soldier.  She is one of hundreds of children  who lost their eyes between 2000-2005 (for her story and pictures, see<a href="http://qumsiyeh.org/hiamsstory/" target="_blank"> http://qumsiyeh.org/<wbr></wbr>hiamsstory/</a>).   I wanedt to visit with friends like Dr. Heidar Eid whom I saw only  when he was able to get out of Gaza and I was able to get out of the  occupied West Bank so that we can meet in a faraway country in Europe. I  want to look in the eyes of Gaza children and tell them that we, the human family, care about them.  We will keep trying. I figure, not trying would be far harder on all of us.<br /><br />

<br /> <br /> We arrived at Istanbul at the 88th anniversary of proclamation of Turkey  as a republic in 1923.  Ataturk’s Turkey evolved quickly into a modern  state at par with other European states. On the news we witness  earthquake destruction in Eastern Turkey and I see a beautiful young girl with  casts on her legs smiling at one point, sad at another and I do not have  to understand the language to understand human tragedy. The damage from  this<br /> natural disaster is chillingly similar to the damage of the man-made  disaster in Gaza: collapsed multistory building, burying dead, injured  people.  <br /><br />But Gaza is not allowed to recover.<br /> <br /> From Istanbul to Dalaman and then to a small lovely town where we stayed  until the launch time.  People here are very friendly.  They become  even friendlier (if that is possible) when they hear I am from Filistin.   But then the whole place reminds me of Filistin (especially northern  Palestine areas of the Galilee).  I take a deep breath and soak the  views of Olives, Citrus, Figs, Almonds, Loquots, mullberies, Jasmine,  cactus, old stone terraces, and old men playing cards or backgammon. The  colors are so bright, the smells so refreshing, the water so abundant.   Smiley comfortable faces with the wrinkles of the hillsides reflected on the  faces of the old people.  The shops, restaurants and hotels are family  run and the young are playful and energetic.  The evening call to prayer  emanates from the mosque. The bicycles all around are never locked and  even our hotel rooms were left open much of the time.   I feel like I am  again visiting North Palestine where my grandmother is from a place that was  also etched in her face and her memory till the day she died.<br /> <br /> Before I proceed any further, I pause to tell you who were most on my  mind in the last four days as we went through the ups and downs and  countless meetings to come to this point.  What was on my mind were  victims of the Israeli apartheid state including these US victims:<br /> <br /> 1) The 34 sailors killed on the USS Liberty attacked deliberately in<br /> International waters in 1967 (<a href="http://www.usslibertyveterans.org/" target="_blank">http://www.<wbr></wbr>usslibertyveterans.org/</a>,<br /> <a href="http://www.gtr5.com/" target="_blank">http://www.gtr5.com/</a> ) and the survivors who have later died without ever<br /> seeing justice for the murderers.<br /> <br /> 2) Rachel Corrie, 23 year old American student killed deliberately by an<br /> Israeli bulldozer in Rafah<br /> <br /> 3) Furkan Dogan, 19 y. o. Turkish American citizen, who was executed at<br /> point blank range on the Mavi Marmara ship (see<br /> <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=19667" target="_blank">http://www.globalresearch.ca/<wbr></wbr>index.php?context=va&aid=19667</a> and smuggled<br /> videos at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT5823U5YLc" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr></wbr>v=vT5823U5YLc</a> and<br /> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjEJGw7BcMo" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr></wbr>v=wjEJGw7BcMo</a> )<br /> <br /> I thought of their bravery as I watched fellow human beings from 10  countries try and even compete to get on boats (some have been to Gaza  several times and some tried to get to Gaza several times).  Driven only  by belief in our common humanity, I as a Palestinian cannot help but feel a  weight of gratitude for these brave souls. We had lots of glitches in  the past few days here with both bureaucratic and political  rollercoaster. I<br /> will spare you the gory details because the ultimate goal is Gaza.  Briefly, we arrived Saturday and were in meetings Sunday when  negotiations started s the boats arrived at docks.  Monday we find that  we are unable to accommodate all passengers per the Turkish authorities (who were not  told our destination).  Monday night we had a meeting till nearly  midnight.<br /><br /> Tuesday was a an emotional rollercoaster as those selected were  approached individually to give their passports. Those of us who were  not asked knew then we were not selected. Passport data went to Ankara  and further delays. Wednesday at 11 AM came back green light to go but a little later, we  heard glitches happening and the authorities were at the doc. When the  boats finally left, five of us “the crazies” raced to our locally  chartered boats<br /> to try and meet.  The cruise Wednesday did not succeed and we had to go  back, disappointed.  But we hope that our colleagues on the Tahrir and  Saoirse will not be intercepted by the navy of the apartheid regime that  is enforcing an illegal and immoral siege on Gaza.<br /> <br /> We live in an Orwellian world where humanitarian activists are  persecuted and war criminals get wined and dined in five star hotels.   We live in a world where for seeking membership in a cultural and  scientific organization (UNESCO) and getting it by a democratic vote:<br /> <br /> - the organization is punished with losing members withholding dues<br /> <br /> - the internet service of 4 million Palestinians under occupation is<br /> targeted by spams and attempts to shut it down (slowed down so far but it<br /> is not clear if the Palestinians will cope with this<br /> <br /> - the occupation authority decides to “punish” the Palestinian population<br /> by building more settlements and by withholding Palestinian tax money (this<br /> is Palestinian money from their taxes due to them).<br /> <br /> - the US congress cuts humanitarian aid going to the Palestinian people<br /> (not going to the Palestinian authority or even passing through its hands).<br /> <br /> It was hard for me to see why we had to be secretive about a  humanitarian operation like this.  It is hard for me to see why the  Turkish authorities limited us to 11 passengers on each boat.  It is  hard for me to see why activists had hard feelings about each other or  why choices were made the way they were.  I had so many questions left  on my mind but for now sadness and anticipation overwhelms everything.<br /> <br /> The human language is so limiting in expressing emotions and feelings on  this day. Words like anticipation, exhilaration, hope, fear, love, are  all rather limiting.  But there is one thing I think is interesting:  when I am in the Galilee, in Al-Walaja, in Aida refugee camp, in an  Israeli holding cell or jail, or attempting to get to Gaza, it is  precisely these times in my life that I feel most alive and most human because I am having  “joyful participation in the sorrows of this world”. Fellow human beings  from Ireland, Canada, USA, Denmark and elsewhere are inspiring and I  quickly became friends with those I did not know before.  They share me these  strong feelings and this makes it even more meaningful. You can see why  Vittorio Arrigoni ended his messages to us with the note “stay human”.  May we all stay most alive and stay most human.<br /> <br /> If you want to help, please use all possible communication means  (emails, twitters, facebook, calls) to let all people especially media  and politicians know you support lifting the siege on Gaza and you want  our ships protected from Israeli piracy.  It is long overdue.<br /> <br /> Now imagine: <a href="http://youtu.be/bvFLKyAGzzI" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/bvFLKyAGzzI</a>
