<p>Two years after "Operation Cast Lead"--Israel’s horrific 22-day all-out  assault of the besieged Palestinian Gaza Strip--which killed  approximately 1,400 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, Israel  continues to collectively punish 1.5 million residents of the Gaza Strip  through an illegal blockade, and to avoid accountability for its  actions.<br /> <br /> The US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation will collect 22,000  signatures in the next 22 days, on the petition below. This petition  calls upon the Obama Administration to:<br /> 1. Demand that Israel end its illegal siege of the Gaza Strip, and<br /> 2. Stop blocking the international community from holding Israel accountable for its actions.<br /> <br /> Help us reach that goal by signing this petition. After doing so, you  can help us spread the word about this petition by alerting your  friends. Thanks for taking action!</p>
