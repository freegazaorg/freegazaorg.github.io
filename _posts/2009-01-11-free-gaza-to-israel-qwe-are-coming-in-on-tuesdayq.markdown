<p>(Cyprus, 11 January 2009) - The Free Gaza Movement ship, "SPIRIT OF<br />HUMANITY," will leave Larnaca Port at 12:00 noon, Monday, 12 January,<br />on an emergency mission to besieged Gaza. The ship will carry<br />desperately needed doctors, journalists, human rights workers, and<br />members of several European parliaments as well as medical supplies.<br />This voyage marks Free Gaza's second attempt to break through the<br />blockade since Israel began attacking the Gaza Strip on 27 December.<br />Between August and December 2008, the Free Gaza Movement successfully<br />challenged the Israeli blockade five times, landing the first<br />international ships in the port of Gaza since 1967.</p>
<p>The Israeli military violently attacked an earlier attempt by the Free<br />Gaza Movement to send an emergency boat filled with doctors and<br />medical supplies to Gaza. In the early hours of Tuesday, 30 December,<br />the Israeli navy deliberately, repeatedly, and without warning rammed<br />the unarmed ship, the DIGNITY, causing significant structural damage<br />and endangering the lives of its passengers and crew. The ship found<br />safe harbor in Lebanon, and is currently awaiting repairs.</p>
<p>Fouad Ahidar, a member of the Belgian Parliament sailing to Gaza<br />aboard the SPIRIT OF HUMANITY, responded to concerns that Israel may<br />attack the unarmed mercy ship by saying, "I have five children that<br />are very worried about me, but I told them, you can sit on your couch<br />and watch these atrocities on the television, or you can choose to<br />take action to make them stop."</p>
<p>Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip have injured thousands of civilians<br />and killed over 800 people, including scores of women and children.<br />This ongoing Israeli massacre severely and massively violates<br />international humanitarian law defined by the Geneva Conventions,<br />especially the obligations of an Occupying Power and the requirements<br />of the laws of war.</p>
<p>The United Nations has failed to protect the Palestinian civilian<br />population from Israel's massive violations of international<br />humanitarian law. Israel has closed off Gaza from the international<br />community and demanded that all foreigners leave. But Huwaida Arraf,<br />an organizer with the Free Gaza Movements, stated that, "We cannot<br />just sit by and wait for Israel to decide to stop the killing and open<br />the borders for relief workers to pick up the pieces. We are coming<br />in. There is an urgent need for this mission as Palestinian civilians<br />in Gaza are being terrorized and slaughtered by Israel, and access to<br />humanitarian relief denied to them. When states and the international<br />bodies responsible for taking action to stop such atrocities chose to<br />be impotent, then we--the citizens of the world--must act. Our common<br />humanity demands nothing less."</p>
<p>Israel has been notified that we are coming. A copy of the<br />notification to the Israeli Authorities is attached.</p>
<p>The media is invited to the Larnaca Port at 10:00am to for final<br />preparations and a press conference before departure.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>WHAT YOU CAN DO</p>
<p>Take Action! CALL the Israeli Government and let them know that the<br />SPIRIT OF HUMANITY is coming to Gaza. DEMAND that Israel immediately<br />STOP slaughtering civilians in Gaza and STOP using violence to prevent<br />human rights and humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>This letter serves as a formal notification to you as the Occupying<br />Power and belligerent force in the Gaza Strip that on Monday, January<br />12 we are navigating the motor vessel, Spirit of Humanity, from the<br />Port of Larnaca to the port of Gaza City. Our vessel will be flying<br />the Greek flag, and, as such, falls under the jurisdiction Greece.</p>
<p>We will be sailing from Cypriot waters into international waters, then<br />directly into the territorial waters of the Gaza Strip without<br />entering or nearing Israeli territorial waters. We expect to arrive<br />at the Gaza Port on Tuesday, January 13, 2009.</p>
<p>We will be carrying urgently needed medical supplies in sealed boxes,<br />cleared by customs at the Larnaca International Airport and the Port<br />of Larnaca. There will be a total of 30 passengers and crew on board,<br />among them members of various European Parliaments and several<br />physicians. Our boat and cargo will also have received security<br />clearance from the Port Authorities in Cyprus before we depart.</p>
<p>As it will be confirmed that neither we, the cargo, any of the boat's<br />contents, nor the boat itself constitute any threat to the security of<br />Israel or its armed forces, we do not expect any interference with<br />our voyage by Israel's authorities.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, December 30, an Israeli Navy vessel violently, and without<br />warning, attacked our motor vessel Dignity, disabling the vessel and<br />endangering the lives of the 16 civilians on board. This notice<br />serves as clear notification to you of our approach. Any attack on the<br />motor vessel, Spirit of Humanity, will be premeditated and any harm<br />inflicted on the 30 civilians on board will be considered the result<br />of a deliberate attack on unarmed civilians.</p>
