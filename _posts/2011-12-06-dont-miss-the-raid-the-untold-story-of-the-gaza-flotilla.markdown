<p>Special: The Raid - The Untold Story of the Gaza Flotilla</p>
<p />

</p>
<p>In May 2010, a six-boat flotilla, carrying more than 700 civilians from almost 40 countries, set sail to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza.</p>
<p>But as international waters were overtaken by the Israeli Navy, what started as a humanitarian effort soon became an international tragedy ending with nine of the activists dead.</p>
<p>The fallout from the attack triggered protests across the Middle East and Europe, along with a shattering of diplomatic ties between former allies Israel and Turkey. Yet Israel defended its decision, claiming the activist were armed and dangerous. But they also made sure to confiscate or destroy all recording devices from the boat.</p>
<p>So what really happened on the Mavi Marmara? Who else was on the other ships? What kind of humanitarian aid did the cargo ships really load?</p>
<p>Thanks to exclusive footage and tapes which were hidden from the Israeli Navy, this film shows the untold story.</p>
