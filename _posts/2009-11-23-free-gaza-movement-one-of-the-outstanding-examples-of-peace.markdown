<p>Every two years, the Bremen Peace Award is given to two or three peacemakers around the world. This year, the Free Gaza movement was nominated for the award and, although we didn't win the top award, we have been included in their brochure as one of the 30 outstanding peace movements.</p>
<p>You can download their PDF file of the awards at <a href="http://www.dieschwelle.de/index.php?id=31&L=1 ">http://www.dieschwelle.de/index.php?id=31&L=1 </a>and see the illustrious company we are keeping. We are on page 60 in the Asia and Middle East awards.</p>
<p>Everyone who has been connected to Free Gaza should be proud of this award. Hundreds are nominated, and we are one of the few chosen.</p>
