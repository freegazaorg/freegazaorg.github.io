<p>RAMALLAH - Israel has received international praise for its decision  to ease its crippling blockade on Gaza following the country's deadly  assault on a humanitarian flotilla trying to bring desperately needed  humanitarian aid to the coastal territory. But according to the UN and  human rights organizations, the easing of the blockade is insufficient  in meeting Gaza's needs.</p>
<p>"Even if the blockade is eased it remains  illegal under international law as it is a collective form of  punishment on a civilian population," Chris Gunness from the UN Relief  and Works Agency (UNRWA) told IPS.</p>
<p>"Eighty percent of Gaza's  population is aid-dependent. Allowing more aid in is perpetuating this  dependency and not addressing the issue of self- sufficiency or the root  causes of the crisis," added Gunness.</p>
