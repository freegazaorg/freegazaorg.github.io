<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;">Free Gaza has been the only organization to send nine voyages to Gaza, successfully entering the port five times in 2008. The 6-boat flotilla was violently stopped May 31, 2010 as we and our coalition partners were trying again to break Israel's illegal siege. That action by Israel has caused several countries to step up and start collecting money to send boats…the UK, the US, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Holland, Norway, Ireland…are all planning on sending boats in the spring of 2011. <br /></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;">Attached below is a three-page summary of the UN Human Rights Council Fact-Finding Mission. Read it and pass it around. It is a vitally important document for us all. Thank you for your support and your donations.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: small;">Please continue to donate so we can keep up the pressure on Israel and the international community to open the sea lane to Gaza.<br /></span></p>
