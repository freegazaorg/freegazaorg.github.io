June 16, 2008, Mohammed Omer, The Electronic Intifada<p>GAZA CITY, 15 June (IPS) - Mahmoud Abu Teior, 13, knows it's Abdullah's kite up in the skies, though he has never seen Abdullah. But that kite rises into the skies from across the Egyptian side of the border across from Gaza. And, Mahmoud knows Abdullah's voice because they speak sometimes. They have never met, and likely never will, but they are connected through their kites.<br /></p><p><a href="http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article9613.shtml">http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article9613.shtml</a></p>
