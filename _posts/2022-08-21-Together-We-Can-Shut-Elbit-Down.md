Dear Supporters of Justice in Palestine,

My name is Ronnie Barkan and I’m a long-time activist in the Palestinian struggle and a serial disrupter to apartheid representatives.

On Nakba Day, May 2022, nine of us from [https://www.palestineaction.org/](https://www.palestineaction.org/) took part in shutting down the headquarters of Elbit Systems, Bristol, UK, which is Israel’s largest arms manufacturer and supplier of almost all killer-drones that hover over Gaza.

The press release stated, “Actionists stormed the flagship premises of Elbit Systems, in Bristol, this afternoon; destroying the building’s interior, dismantling offices and equipment, and barricading themselves inside, while others blocked road access to the site. The large group of activists, which includes two Israeli dissidents, have taken direct action against Elbit Systems to demand an end to British complicity with Israeli apartheid.” [https://www.palestineaction.org/bristol-nakba/](https://www.palestineaction.org/bristol-nakba/)

I’m one of the two Israeli dissidents and that’s why I’m writing to you today. All nine of us were arrested, but seven UK citizens were released after a few days. The two of us from Israel were denied bail and incarcerated for a month before being released under strict bail conditions that we not speak to each other or to the other activists, wear an ankle bracelet and turn in our passports. And we are now prevented from leaving the UK until the court date on April 17, 2023. 

Unfortunately, I don’t qualify for legal aid here and I have to fully cover my legal defence which amounts to £50,000. I’m represented by Kellys Solicitors and Garden Court Chambers who are already in the middle of preparatory work and attending court hearings. My expenses have started to pile up and I’m depending on your help.

The money is raised through CrowdJustice and funds go directly to Kellys Solicitors. If you click on this link, [https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/helpronnie/](https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/helpronnie/) you’ll be able to help me fight apartheid by donating. I’m proud of the work we’ve done and of the numerous other actionists and supporters who are determined to end the horrendous crimes that take place under our noses. I greatly appreciate your donation and sharing it with your friends, social circles and families. Together, we can shut Elbit down.
