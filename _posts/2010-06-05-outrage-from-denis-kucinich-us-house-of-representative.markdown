<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">The Honorable Barack Obama</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">President of the United States</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">The White House </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">Washington, DC 20500</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">Dear Mr. President,</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">Israeli commandos, acting at the direction of the State of Israel, attacked and seized a Turkish ship in international waters, in the Mediterranean Sea.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">At least nine were killed in the incident aboard the Mavi Marmara.  Hundreds of civilians were taken into custody and goods were confiscated. Since the United States considers Israel our most important ally in the region, whose survival is a primary concern, it is incumbent upon the Commander in Chief to call Israel to an accounting for its conduct in planning and executing the deadly military attack in international waters upon a peaceful flotilla carrying citizens from over 50 countries. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">The State of Israel's conduct, attacking a Turkish ship in international waters, constitutes an act of belligerence against Turkey, which at one time Israel considered an important ally. It also undermines United States’ troops efforts in Iraq, since your administration's efforts to achieve stability in the region and to withdraw troops from Iraq has depended upon Turkey's cooperation through use of its air bases. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">In its violent commando raid on the Mavi Marmara, the government of Israel showed no concern as to how its conduct may affect the lives of defenseless, innocent people, its friends and allies, and in particular the United States. The United States must remind Israel as well as all of our other friends and allies:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"><br /> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">It is not acceptable to repeatedly violate international law. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"><br /> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">It is not acceptable to shoot and kill innocent civilians. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"><br /> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">It is not acceptable to commit an act of aggression against another U.S. ally. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"><br /> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">It is not acceptable to continue a blockade which denies humanitarian relief. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"><br /> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">It is not acceptable to heighten tensions in a region while the United States continues to put so much blood and treasure on the line. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"><br /> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">The State of Israel's action necessitates that the United States, which is Israel's partner in the region, begin to redefine its relationship and to establish such boundaries and conditions which are sufficient for mutual respect and cooperation. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"><br /> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">It is incumbent upon Israeli officials to bring forth the truth about the planning for and the attack upon the Mavi Marmara. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"><br /> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">No one questions the right of Israel to defend its border, but that defense does not extend to shooting innocent civilians anywhere in the world, anytime it pleases.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"><br /> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">Israel must account for our support, for the lives of our soldiers, for the investment of billions from our taxpayers.  Israel owes the United States more than reckless, pre-meditated violence waged against innocent people. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">The attack on the Mavi Marmara requires consequences for the Netanyahu Administration and for the State of Israel. Those consequences must be dealt by the United States. They must be diplomatic and they must be financial. The U.S. can begin by calling for an independent international inquiry of the Mavi Marmara incident. The integrity of such inquiry necessitates that it not be led by the nation whose conduct is under scrutiny. If our nation fails to act in any substantive way, the United States licenses the violence and we are complicit in it and our own citizens will be forced to pay the consequences. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"><br /> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;">We the undersigned deeply regret the loss of life. We are also fully aware of the dangers to world security which exist in the region, which is why the United States has been unstinting it its defense of Israel. We have a right to expect that Israel not add to those dangers with military conduct which all people of good will know is neither defensible nor moral. There must be consequences for such conduct. We await your response.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #333333;"> Sincerely,</span></div>
</span>
