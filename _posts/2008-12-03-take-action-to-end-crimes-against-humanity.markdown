<p>Dear friends:</p><p>It is only in an Orwellian &quot;might makes right&quot; world that 1.5 million people are kept in a concentration camp literally being starved to death while much of the world governments stand idly watching or occasionally issuing a useless statement or collaborating with the collective punishment (as in the case of Governments of Egypt and the US).&nbsp; 1.5 million are not numbers, they are people like you and me and 60% are children!!&nbsp; Terrorism is defined as punishing civilians to force a change in politics.&nbsp; As such this is the biggest act of terrorism since the end of WWII.&nbsp; It is also a war crime and a crime against humanity (as defined by International Law).&nbsp; </p><p>Below is an action alert from the US Campaign to End the Occupation on this abominable situation. Please take some time to act and especially write to Obama and tell him and Demand real change instead of appointments of people whom AIPAC approves <a href="http://change.gov/page/s/contact" target="_blank">http://change.gov/page/s/contact</a></p><p>The tragedy does not stop there: the European Parliament (EP) has recently announced that a vote will be held tomorrow (December 4) to enter into force the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which will enable far greater Israeli participation in European Community programs. Follow the link below to see how you can contact your MEP (if you are in Europe) to demand that they vote against the agreement.</p><p><a href="http://www.fosis.org.uk/actaware/index.php/alerts/1-global/93-eu-israel-action-plan--contact-your-mep-now" target="_blank">http://www.fosis.org.uk/actaware/index.php/alerts/1-global/93-eu-israel-action-plan--contact-your-mep-now</a></p><p>And forward this widely to all people you know who may act on reminders of their conscience!</p><p>Mazin Qumsiyeh, PhD<br />Bethlehem University, Occupied Palestine</p><p><a href="http://windowintopalestine.blogspot.com/2008/11/end-starvation-and-seige-of-gaza-rally.html" target="_blank">http://windowintopalestine.blogspot.com/2008/11/end-starvation-and-seige-of-gaza-rally.html</a></p><p><a href=""></a></p>
