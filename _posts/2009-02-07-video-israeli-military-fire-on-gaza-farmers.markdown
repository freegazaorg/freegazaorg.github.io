Abassan Jedida, The Gaza Strip, Thursday 5th February, 2009 - Returning to farm the land where Israeli soldiers had opened fire on them 2 days previously, farmers and HRWs were able to harvest the parsley crop for only half an hour, before soldiers again began to shoot. A number of shots were fired into the air, before the soldiers started to aim in the direction of the farmers and international accompaniment. Bullets were heard to whiz past, close to peoples heads. <a target="_blank" href="http://palsolidarity.org/2009/02/5065"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #810081;">http://palsolidarity.org/2009/02/5065</span></span></a>
