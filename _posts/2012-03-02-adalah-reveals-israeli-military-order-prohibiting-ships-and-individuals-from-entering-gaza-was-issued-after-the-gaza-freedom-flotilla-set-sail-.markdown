<div style="text-align: center;">
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<p dir="LTR" style="width: 600px; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Comes in Response to Supreme Court Petition Demanding                                                 Criminal Indictment of MK Zoabi for her Participation in the Flotilla</strong></span></p>
<strong> </strong></h2>

<p dir="LTR" style="width: 600px; text-align: justify;">On 14  February 2012, Adalah revealed that the Israeli military order  prohibiting ships and individuals from traveling to the Gaza Strip was  issued after the Gaza Freedom Flotilla left Turkish shores. Adalah  disclosed that the order was issued on 28 May 2010 while the ships were  already in international waters. Therefore, there was no legal  impediment to the ships arrival in Gaza or any legal basis for their  seizure. Adalah received a copy of the military order, signed by  Commander of the Israeli Navy Eliezar Marom, through a representative of  detainees that joined the Freedom Flotilla from the High Follow-Up  Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="width: 600px; text-align: justify;">The information is part of Adalah's response on behalf of MK Haneen  Zoabi to a Supreme Court petition filed last month by far-right Knesset  member Michael Ben Ari and right-wing activist Itamar Ben-Gvir.  MK Ben  Ari's petition demands that the Attorney General criminally indict MK  Zoabi for her participation in the Gaza Freedom Flotilla in May 2010.</p>
<p dir="LTR" style="width: 600px; text-align: justify;">The Attorney General closed the investigation into the alleged offenceof  illegal entry into Gaza by Israeli citizens, including MK Zoabi, on 22  December 2011. <strong>The AG decided to drop the case following "significant  evidence-based and legal difficulties that were discovered in regard to  proving the basis of the offense, as well as legal questions regarding  the jurisdiction of Israeli penal law on crimes committed abroad."1</strong></p>
<p dir="LTR" style="width: 600px; text-align: justify;">The General Director of Adalah, Attorney Hassan Jabareen, argued in the  response that the petitioners are ignorant of the facts, including that  the military order was issued after the flotilla's departure. They are  also unaware, he argued, that MK Zoabi enjoys parliamentary immunity  that applies to all of her political activities – in and out of the  Knesset - while she serves as a public elected official.  He added that  the petition does not address the fact that the ships were attacked and  seized in international waters in an area that is not subject to Israeli  domestic criminal law. In addition, the petitioners failed to produce  any evidence for their claim that MK Zoabi used violence against any  person during the seizure of the Mavi Marmara ship.</p>
