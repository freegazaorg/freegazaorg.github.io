<p>This week's update is lighter in tone than last week's update.Â  It gives you an idea of what we are doing to get the Free Gaza ready. We are hoping this time to entertain you a bit (our first mate would do well at open-mike night) and to let you know that we have enjoyed fixing the boat. We leave next Thursday, so the update for next week will be interviews of some of the people asking them why they want to go back.<br /> <br />{youtube}rUlcJs7BKBU{/youtube}</p>
