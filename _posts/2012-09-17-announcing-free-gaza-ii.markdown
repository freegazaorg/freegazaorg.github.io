<div><span style="color: #000000;">We  are pleased to announce the members of the new Free Gaza working board who will work  on Gaza-centered projects, in accordance with FG's original mission statement: "We  sail as an expression of citizen nonviolent, direct action,   confronting Israel's ongoing abuses of Palestinian human and political   rights and will continue to challenge Israel's illegal siege on Gaza."<br /><br /></span></div>
<span style="color: #000000;">The members are: <br /></span>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"><br /></span>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> Ann Wright (US)</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Lubna Masarwa (Palestine48) </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Muhsen Abu Ramadan (Gaza)</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Maria del Mar Fernandez (Spain)</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Audrey Bomse (US) </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Greta Berlin (France).</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"><br /></span></div>
</div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Other members of the former Free Gaza board wan<em>t </em>to focus on issues affecting Palestine and the wider region,  including working with youth from the Arab Spring. They believe that there is a need to gauge developments in the region before announcing any actions.<br /> <br /></span><span style="color: #000000;">Free Gaza could not have been successful in boldly challenging Israel’s  criminal blockade and setting new standards for global civilian direct action without the hard work and dedication of all who  served as board members, organizers and supporters in various forms throughout the years. We all will continue to work for a free Palestine."</span></div>

<div><span style="color: #000000;">Bios and ways you can donate to Gaza's Ark will be added to the website next week. <br /></span></div>
