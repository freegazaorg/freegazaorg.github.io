We just spoke to the passengers. Everyone is OK, but the situation is still very tense. They continue to be surrounded by Israeli warships which are threatening to open fire. The Israeli Navy is actively jamming all navigation systems in violation of international maritime law, endangering the people on board. <br /> <br />Former U.S. Congresswoman, <a title="Cynthia McKinney" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_McKinney">Cynthia McKinney</a>, speaking from on board the SPIRIT, stated, "I am extremely angry. We demand that the Israeli government call off their attack dogs. We are unarmed civilians aboard an unarmed boat delivering medical and reconstruction aid to other human beings in Gaza. Why in God's name would Israel want to attack us and threaten our safety and welfare. I call on President Obama and the international community to intervene now to prevent this situation from escalating with potentially drastic results to the civilians on board."<br /> <br />Since the boat's navigation equipment is being jammed, it has turned westward in order to stay in international waters.The Captain and crew are working from the most ancient of navigation equipment...the compass to stay clear of Israeli waters.<br />
