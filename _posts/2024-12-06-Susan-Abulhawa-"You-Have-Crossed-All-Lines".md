This brilliant speech is probably the most powerful piece of rhetoric about this conflict. This speech will go down in history. Please watch and continue to share. Bless this woman for her strength and courage, it's hard to believe her truth is not shouted from the rooftops. Israel is committing genocide, and it's played out every day on social media. It's heartbreaking. 

As she says in the speech, "This debate is ultimately about the humanity and worth of Palestinians."
