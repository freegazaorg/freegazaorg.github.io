<p><strong>17 June 2011 | Istanbul</strong></p>
<p>For Immediate Release:</p>
<p>Freedom Flotilla II - Stay Human is a rainbow coalition of human rights  defenders. It does not only concern Muslims, but everyone, be they  Muslim, Christian, Jew, Hindu, secular or whatever. This is world  citizenry united. <strong>Our destination is Gaza. Our means are non-violent. Our goal is to lift the illegal siege, completely and permanently and freedom for the Palestinian people.</strong></p>
<p>With national campaigns in over 20 countries and  around 10 ships being readied, Freedom Flotilla II - Stay Human is on track  to sail to Gaza to break the illegal Israeli blockade. The Turkish aid  organization IHH remains part of the flotilla, even though the Mavi  Marmara is unable to sail.</p>
<p>Israel’s policy of collective punishment remains intact. There is no doubt about the need for the flotilla. The  so-called “established channels” for delivering aid to Gaza, referred  to by global leaders seeking to stop our mission, do not allow for the  needs of the people of Gaza to be met due to Israel’s many restrictions,  nor do they permit freedom for Palestinians.</p>
<p>Nowhere else in the world are people required by the  international community to accept humanitarian aid instead of freedom.  And even that humanitarian aid is not forthcoming, owing to Israel’s  blockade. This month, the health authority in Gaza proclaimed a state of  emergency due to an acute shortage of vital medicines. Approximately  178 types of medications and 123 types of medical supplies have run out,  and an additional 69 types of medications and 70 types of medical  supplies are expected to run out within the next three months.</p>
<p>A few days ago, 46 Palestinian civil society organizations announced their full support of the Freedom Flotilla 2.</p>
<p><strong> The  fact that the Mavi Marmara will not participate in the FF2, means that  the misinformation put forward by the Israeli government and its  supporters that the flotilla is a “Turkish” and “Islamist” effort will  be completely exposed. Hundreds of people from around the world are  sailing to break the blockade on Gaza.</strong> Freedom Flotilla II will include more ships than the  first flotilla, even without the Mavi Marmara. Moreover, the coalition  consists of significantly more member organizations this time, from all  over Europe, North America, the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
