<p>(July 5, 2008) To: friendsofgaza at gmail.com. Dear Friends,<br />Please accept my support for your forthcoming peace boat journey to break the Siege of Gaza. You carry with you the hopes and wishes of many people around the world that the Siege will end and that the people of Gaza will soon have their freedom and human rights respected by the Israeli Government. The Siege of Gaza is a shameful act of collective punishment of the people of Gaza by the Israeli Government and it's time they realized that only through serious dialogue and negotiations with the democratically elected Hamas Reps. will the Palestinian/Israeli conflict be solved. Salaam, Shalom, Mairead Maguire, Nobel Peace Laureate</p><p><a href=""></a></p>
