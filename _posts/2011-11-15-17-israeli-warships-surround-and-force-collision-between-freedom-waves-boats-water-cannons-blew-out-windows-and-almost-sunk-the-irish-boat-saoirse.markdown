<p><strong>Why I wanted to Challenge the Israeli Naval Blockade of Gaza</strong></p>
<p>In the overland five trips I have made to Gaza since March, 2009, I  have seen the disastrous effect of the brutal Israeli land and sea  blockade has had on the Palestinian people. I have seen the terrible  level of destruction that the 2008-2009 Israeli attack wrecked on Gaza,  in which 1,400 Palestinians were killed in the 22 day attack, 5,000 were  wounded and 50,000 were made homeless. I was on the Gaza Freedom March  in 2009 and I was a passenger on the <a href="http://ustogaza.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">US Boat to Gaza</a>, the “Audacity of Hope” that was forbidden from sailing June, 2011 by the Greek government on behalf of the Israeli government.</p>
<p>As one of two American citizens on the Gaza “Freedom Waves,” I  represented hundreds of thousands of Americans who are challenging  Israeli and US policies concerning Palestine. We are using a variety of  methods to let Israeli government officials know that international  citizen activists are not going to stop challenging their policies.  Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions programs, international citizens who  attempt to protection Palestinians as the farm, fish and go to school,  students confronting Israeli officials as they speak around the world  and flotillas and waves of boats are part of the international effort. I  am very proud to be a part of this movement.</p>
