Just spoke to the folks on board (3am our time). They're all fine. They're still surrounded by the Israeli navy &amp; their systems are being jammed (including the SPOT beacon &amp; GPS). They're taking a generally westerly course so as to avoid accidentally drifting into Israeli waters &amp; will navigate by sight as soon as day breaks. <br /><br />They continue toward Gaza...
