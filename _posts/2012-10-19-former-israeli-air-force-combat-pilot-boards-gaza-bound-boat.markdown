<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Israeli               peace activist Yonatan Shapira, who had been a combat               pilot in the Israeli Air Force and refused to take part in               the bombing of Palestinian cities, has arrived on board               the Swedish boat "Estelle" which is making her way towards               the coast of Gaza. When the Estelle passed near the shores               of Greece, Shapira and other activists made their way in a               motor boat, evading vessels of the Greek Coast Guard which               sought to bar their way. "Along with the Greek Coast Guard                we saw a ship which seemed very much like an Israeli Navy               vessel, though it did not fly a flag" said Shapira. He was               received with cheers by activists already on board.               Shapira had taken part in a similar sailing last year,               being taken off by Israeli Navy Commandos near the Gaza               shore and spending time in police detention, but not               charged with any criminal offence. </span></span>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #222222;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">Meanwhile,               Israel's Ambassador to the UN Ron Prosor has sent a letter               calling on the United Nations to stop the Estelle from               reaching her destination. To this activists on board               respond: "If this means that Israel has decided to cede               control over Palestinian territorial waters to the UN,               this would actually be a step forward.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The               UN and many other representatives of the International               Community have for years characterized the siege of the               Gaza strip as inhuman and incompatible with International               Law.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ship               to Gaza Sweden assumes that that UN will not take over the               implementation of this policy, by itself preventing a               peaceful vessel from delivering humanitarian supplies.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ship               to Gaza and the Freedom Flotilla have never opposed lawful               inspections of cargo and vessel by representatives of the               UN, as well as  by national authorities in the ports and               waters we have passed through. We welcome further               inspections of this kind by the UN, once we have anchored               at Gaza City. What we refuse to accept is something which               also the UN and the majority of The International               Community oppose: The illegal siege of the Gaza Strip,               with its devastating humanitarian results. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The               Estelle has now set course to Gaza and, weather               permitting, is due to get there on Saturday.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Adam               Keller, Spokesperson of Gush Shalom, who is in ongoing               contact with the Estelle activists, says that Israel's               Prime Minister and Defense Minister still have some               forty-eight hours' grace to make a wise and courageous               decision, avoid another show of Israeli brute force in               international waters and let the Estelle dock at the Port               of Gaza – while implementing a thorough UN inspection of               her cargo,  to which the activists  specifically consent. </span></span></p>
