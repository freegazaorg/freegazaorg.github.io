<p>This Mother's Day, CodePink Women for Peace held their second 24-hour vigil in front of the White House, where they honored all mothers and women who live where war is happening- where women are paying the price with their bodies, loved ones, homes, future. they wanted to recognize the price they pay and honor their courage and power, by standing with them in solidarity to not only tell their important stories but to model what women-centered community looks and acts like. We wanted to encourage other organizations and community groups around the country and the world to bring their stories to celebrate <a href="http://www.womensaynotowar.org/article.php?id=217" target="_blank">Julia Ward Howe's original call for Mother's Day</a>.</p>
<p>The Free Gaza Movement was there to remind the world of the plight of Palestinian mothers and the need for action:</p>
