<p>(March 30, 2009) DEAR FRIENDS: The Free Gaza Movement will again challenge Israel's illegal closure of the Gaza Strip and collective punishment of its civilian population by sailing the HOPE FLEET, a flotilla of passenger and cargo ships, to Gaza at the end of May 2009 - to be followed by freedom riders this summer. We are turning to you, our friends &amp; supporters, to help make Hope come alive.</p>

Our small yet committed group has already made five successful voyages to Gaza, delivering needed human rights workers &amp; humanitarian supplies, taking out Palestinian students and medical patients, and helping to lessen Gaza's terrible isolation from the world. We are confident that with the universal outrage over Israel's massacres in Gaza we will be able to send a flotilla of ships to shatter the siege and deliver a message of international hope and solidarity to the people of Palestine.
<p>March 30th, 2009 marks the BDS (Boycott/Divestment/Sanctions) Global Day of Action against Israeli violence [1]. Responsible BDS actions were used to end apartheid in South Africa. Today, Israeli policies of racism, ethnic cleansing and the brutal military occupation of Palestine demand equally determined &amp; direct action to overcome them. When our governments fail to act, we - the citizens of the world - must stand up and make our voices heard. Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights grants all people the right to leave and return to their own country - a right that Israel summarily denies Palestinians.</p>
<p>We are looking for ships wishing to join the Hope Fleet and sail to Gaza in late May, and we are looking for high-profile people, including parliamentarians and celebrities, who want to join us and demand that a besieged Gaza cannot forever remain an open-air prison with no access to the world. The Free Gaza Movement will continue to challenge Israel's brutal policies. We will go to Gaza again, and again, and again, until the Israeli siege is broken and the people of Gaza have access to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>If you are interested in joining or supporting this action, please email Iristulip(at)gmail.com. We will begin collecting names and information as we ready for this historic voyage. With your help, we will make the HOPE FLEET a reality.</p>

<p>[1] Land Day, known as ‘Youm al-Ard' in Arabic, commemorates the bloody killing of six Palestinians in the Galilee on March 30, 1976 by Israeli troops during peaceful protests over the confiscation of Palestinian lands. It has since become a painful reminder of Israeli injustice and oppression against the Palestinian people, and a day for demonstration linking all Palestinians in their struggle against occupation, self-determination and national liberation. <a href="http://www.miftah.org/Display.cfm?DocId=3410&amp;CategoryId=4">http://www.miftah.org/Display.cfm?DocId=3410&amp;CategoryId=4</a></p>
