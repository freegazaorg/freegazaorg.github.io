<p>From Huwaida Arraf, a moving tribute to Vittorio:</p>
<p><br /> Below is a link to TedxRamallah, which took place on Saturday in<br /> Bethlehem, simultaneously webcast in 20 cities around the world,<br /> including Gaza, where people gathered in a hall to watch, London,<br /> Beirut, Montreal, etc.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.tedxramallah.com/eventday/" target="_blank">http://www.tedxramallah.com/<wbr></wbr>eventday/</a><br /> <br /> I used my minutes to pay a very humble tribute to Vittorio. You can<br /> watch at Part 1, starting at 1:18 (after one hour and 18 minutes). The<br /> entire hall stood up to give Vik a standing ovation, and some wrote to<br /> me from Gaza, London, and Beirut to tell me that folks watching with<br /> them burst into tears.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiAy5GaFuRs" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr></wbr>v=XiAy5GaFuRs</a></p>
