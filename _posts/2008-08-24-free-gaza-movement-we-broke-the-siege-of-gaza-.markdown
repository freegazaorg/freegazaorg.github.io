<p>On August 23, 2008, the Free Gaza Movement broke the Siege of Gaza. It was world news yesterday, thousands of people cried for joy,&nbsp;and there is an enourmous amount of footage and coverage. A press conference in Gaza is taking place now, on Sunday morning. Press release follows shortly on this website. Thanks to everybody who made this possible. And: this is certainly not the end of the story.</p><p><a href=""></a></p>
