<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">His Excellency Mr. Mark Sofer,<br />Ambassador of Israel,<br />Carisbrook House <br />122 Pembroke Rd,<br />Ballsbridge <br />Dublin 4,</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">C&eacute;adaoin 19 Samhain 2008</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Dear Mr Sofer,</p><p class="MsoNormal">I wish to protest in the strongest terms at the arrest by your country&rsquo;s navy of three fishing boats operating out of Gaza along with their crews and three international observers onboard.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I would ask that you, convey this protest to your government and ask when will the confiscated boats be returned to their rightful owners; when will the 3 international observers, Victor Arrigoni from Italy, Andrew Muncie from Scotland and Darlene Wallach from the USA, be released back to Gaza; when will all three have access to legal representation?</p><p class="MsoNormal">I would remind you that the Israeli Navy have no business operating in Palestinian waters, least of all arresting boats and their crews, since the Oslo Agreement of 1994 established a 20-mile limit. The boats in question were fishing seven miles off the coast of Deir Al Balah, clearly in Gaza fishing waters, when they were intercepted by the Israeli Navy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hopefully, your government will react positively to this letter of protest and release the three observers and return the boats intact to their owners.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Is mise </p><p class="MsoNormal">Aengus Ã“ Snodaigh TD</p><p><a href=""></a></p>
