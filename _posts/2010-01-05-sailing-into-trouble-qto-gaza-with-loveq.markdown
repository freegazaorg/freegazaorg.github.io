<p><span><span><em>To Gaza with Love</em> is a documentary by Aki Nawaz for Iran's English-language channel Press TV. It is an account of the first boats that successfully broke the siege of Gaza in August 2008. The filmmakers traveled to the Gaza Strip with the Free Gaza Movement, which organized the trip. The subjective format of the film works well -- presenter Yvonne Ridley speaks to the camera in an amiable video diary style, while Nawaz narrates to add context.<img src="http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article10981.shtml" /></span></span></p>
