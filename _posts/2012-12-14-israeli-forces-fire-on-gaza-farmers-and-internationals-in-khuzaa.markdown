<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>December 12th, 2012</strong>: Gaza- Israeli  forces fired live ammunition and tear gas at unarmed farmers and  international solidarity activists working in Khuza’a, a small village  outside of Khan Younis located near the Israeli border. At 10:30 AM, the  farmers arrived and began to plough approximately 100 meters from the  separation fence while internationals lined up in between the border and  the farmers. They were quickly met by an Israeli military jeep and  transport vehicle. An Israeli soldier issued a warning in Arabic to  leave the area and then fired two rounds into the air. The farmers and  internationals remained calm and continued their work and the Israeli  soldiers left the area. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;">At around 11 AM,  approximately 20 Palestinians and farmers gathered around 300 meters  back from the fence. Two military jeeps returned to the area. One  soldier exited his vehicle and fired four shots in the direction of the  farmers and activists. The fourth shot crossed the line of the activists  and landed in the field being ploughed. Again, the Palestinians and  internationals were not deterred. The Israeli jeeps left and the farmers  finished working on this section of land and moved on to an adjacent  plot.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fifteen minutes  later, two Israeli jeeps returned, one equipped with an automatic  machine gun. A soldier fired three canisters of tear gas directly in  front of the activists. He proceeded to shoot at the tractor, damaging  its engine and bringing the work to a halt. An international was  accompanying the driver aboard the tractor. The accompaniment team  included participants from Spain, Italy, France, England, Scotland,  Germany and the United States </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gazan farmers  successfully ploughed and sowed wheat in adjacent plots, with the  presence of internationals, during the two days prior to the incident.  Though they were issued warnings by Israeli forces to stay 100 meters  from the fence, they were not fired upon in a similar fashion. "This  incident is a prime example of the military harassment and  unpredictability of the Israeli occupation forces that farmers routinely  face while working their land in Gaza," said Maria del Mar Fernandez from Free Gaza.<br /></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br /></span></div>
<sup><span style="font-size: small;"> </span>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">Residents from  Khuza’a said they have not planted in this area, declared a closed  military zone by Israel, for the past thirteen years. Formerly an  orchard, Israeli forces bulldozed the field multiple times during  military incursions and regularly shoots at farmers who attempt to work  there. Farmers were under the impression that this area was now  accessible after the November 21st ceasefire’s stipulations that Israeli  forces would "refrain from targeting residents in the border areas" and  to "stop all hostilities in the Gaza Strip land, sea and air including  incursions and targeting of individuals." </span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">This is the optimum season for  planting wheat and the Gaza farmers only have a small window of time  in which to work before the land will be rendered unusable.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">Today, Gazan  farmers from Khuza'a, a small village near Khan Younis, worked on their  land in defiance of Israeli military harassment. Farmers ploughed  approximately seven dunams and then sowed wheat in a plot that they had  previously been denied access to before the November 21st, 2012  ceasefire. The farmers successfully worked up to 100 meters from the  separation fence. The Israeli military arbitrarily designates this area  as a restricted military buffer zone, otherwise known as the "kill  zone." According to the workers, they have not been able to farm on this  specific plot of land for the past ten years. Formerly an orchard,  Israeli forces bulldozed the field multiple times during military  incursions and regularly shoots at farmers who attempt to work there. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">At approximately  8:00 AM, the Palestinian farmers began their morning‘s activities when  two Israeli tanks, one military jeep and five bulldozers lined up across  from the farmers on the Israeli side of the fence, threatening to fire.  Around 9:30 AM, the farmers were joined by a group of 14 solidarity  activists from Gaza, Spain, Italy, France, England, Ireland, Scotland,  Germany and the United States. The Israeli forces left after half an  hour and were quickly replaced by two more military jeeps. </span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">The  Palestinians and internationals stood their ground approximately 100  meters from the fence despite multiple Israeli warnings to leave the  area. One of the international activists accompanied a Gaza driver  aboard his tractor to act as a deterrent to Israeli fire. Other farmers  sowed wheat by hand. The work concluded around 12:30 PM without any fire  from Israeli forces. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">This was a small, yet very important victory for the farmers, especially as Israel has frequently and unapologetically </span><a href="http://occupiedpalestine.wordpress.com/2012/12/02/gazaunderattack-4th-israeli-violation-of-truce-palestinian-injured-after-being-shot-by-israeli-troops-in-gaza/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-size: small;">breached</span></span></span></span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> the ceasefire’s stipulations to "refrain from targeting residents in  the border areas" and to "stop all hostilities in the Gaza Strip land,  sea and air including incursions and targeting of individuals." </span></div>
