We are excited to combine both groups who have worked so hard on this project and are so enthusiastic about setting out for Gaza. On the way in today, we had the Cypriot authorities escorting us. Now, it&rsquo;s time for the world to escort us to Gaza.&rdquo; Said Paul Larudee, one of the organizers. <span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: verdana"><br /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal">After a thorough inspection of both boats, the port authority will let the 20 passengers from Cyprus on board to make final preparations, including a memorial service for the more than 5000 Palestinians who have lost their lives since September 2000 as well as the 34 sailors aboard the USS Liberty who were assassinated by Israel in 1967. They, like the Palestinians, will not be forgotten. That service should be on Thursday, August 21 just before the boats begin their final journey to Gaza. <span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: verdana"><br /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;It was exhilarating to watch the boats come in after waiting so patiently over the past two weeks. Seeing the sail on the Free Gaza followed to port by the Liberty has been worth the wait. Now we will get the boats ready to sail to Gaza, because that is our final destination. We are looking forward to going as soon as possible. &rdquo; Said a delighted Fathi Jaouadi, one of the passengers on board. <span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: verdana"><br /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal">The boats will be in port for the next two days for media to photograph. The human rights workers on board will also be available for interviews.</p><p class="MsoNormal">(For French translation see <a href="http://www.silviacattori.net/article518.html" target="_blank">http://www.silviacattori.net/article518.html</a>) <font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2"><br /></font></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2" /></font></strong><p><a href=""></a></p>
