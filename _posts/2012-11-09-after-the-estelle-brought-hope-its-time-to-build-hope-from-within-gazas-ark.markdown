Through the tenacity of the crew and the media who told their           story, the Estelle’s message to Palestinians and to the world           is that <strong>we will not stop, we will not forget, we will not             condone the blockade that is strangling Gaza</strong>. Now, we           are launching a new initiative that will take these efforts to           another level. It's called Gaza's Ark, and instead of focusing           on bringing supplies and internationals into Gaza, it will           showcase the need to allow the free movement of people and           exports out.</div>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> <br /> The goal of the project -- run jointly by civil society groups           in Gaza and  a committee of internationals – is to hire local           workers to rebuild an existing boat, stock it with locally           made goods for export and sail it out! (You can find a lot           more detail at <a href="http://www.gazaark.org" target="_blank">www.gazaark.org</a>). <br /> <br /> Yes, we know Israel will very likely try to stop this ship too           and very well may succeed. But even if this happens, we will           have created some <strong>much-needed employment</strong> for           Palestinians in Gaza; <strong>simulated </strong><strong>the</strong><strong> local             economy</strong> and paid manufacturers, farmers and craftspeople           for products that are now sitting unsold in warehouses; and <strong>brought </strong><strong>media attention to Gaza </strong>along the way on Israel's           continuing ban on exports from Gaza (without which a           functioning economy is not possible).<br /> <br /> However, we need your help to make this happen. Before the           work can start, we need to have $40,000. Please visit <em><a href="http://www.gazaark.org" target="_blank">www.gazaark.org</a></em> today            and click on the "donate" button to give whatever you can. No           amount is too small! <br /> <br /> <strong>The call is coming from Palestine to make Gaza's Ark a             reality. </strong><strong>Watch </strong>this video           (<a href="http://www.gazaark.org/2012/11/07/video-gazas-fishers/" target="_blank">http://www.gazaark.org/2012/<wbr></wbr>11/07/video-gazas-fishers/</a>),           produced in Gaza by a local filmmaker, in which fishermen who           brave the threat of Israeli guns in order to make a living           explain why. Please watch and share!</span></div>
