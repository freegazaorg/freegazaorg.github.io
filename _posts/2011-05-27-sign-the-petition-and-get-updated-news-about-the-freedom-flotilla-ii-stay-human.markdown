<p>We  are writing to ask for your support for the Gaza Freedom Flotilla  scheduled to set sail in the second half of June to the besieged Gaza  strip.</p>
<p>At least ten ships with dignitaries, doctors, professors, artists,  journalists, and activists, as well as construction supplies and  humanitarian aid, will sail from ports in Europe to Gaza in an act of  non-violent civil disobedience to persuade the international community  to fulfill its obligations towards the Palestinian people and end  Israel's four-year illegal blockade of Gaza.<br /><br />This is the second,  large-scale citizen-to-citizen flotilla to be launched by international  grassroots groups. Organized by 14 national groups and international  coalitions, the flotilla will carry approximately 1,000 passengers. It  includes a US boat named The Audacity of Hope, which will have aboard  dozens of dedicated social justice activists (visit: <a href="http://ustogaza.org/" target="_blank">http://ustogaza.org/</a>).</p>
