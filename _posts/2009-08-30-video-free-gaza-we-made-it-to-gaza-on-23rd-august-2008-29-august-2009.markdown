<p><span>We will return. We will come back. We will never forget.<br /><br />A year ago, 23rd August 2008, 44 of us saw the coastline of Gaza in the distance, after 30 hours of traveling across the Mediterranean Sea. We were jubilant. We had made it to Gaza. We had actually made it to Gaza. We had really, really made it to Gaza.<br /><br />We had MADE IT TO GAZA.</span><br /><br />Thank you to all of you who made this possible, who worked on the land crew, who sent out the information to your lists, who covered the story while we were in Gaza. 44 of us made it to Gaza last year, but we were supported by hundreds of you<br clear="all" /><span style="color: #888888;"> </span></p>
