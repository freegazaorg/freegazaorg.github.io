A brief report &amp; relevant YouTube link:<br />&nbsp;<br />Gazan territorial waters, 18th October 2008 - At approximately 12:30, a Palestinian fishing vessel from the port in Gaza City, was traveling 6km off the coast of Deir Al Balah. An Israeli Dvora class gunboat (no. 831) approached the fishing boat, began circling it and opened fire. The&nbsp;incident lasted several minutes and was witnessed and documented by a human rights observer with the International Solidarity Movement - who was present on the Palestinian boat. A short video of the incident is posted here.<br />&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNUvUrUaBMA" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNUvUrUaBMA</a><p><a href=""></a></p>
