<p>We are returning to Gaza for exactly the same reasons we came in August: to deliver medical supplies, meet with civil society organizations, volunteer in hospitals, and visit Palestinians who have requested our presence. <br /><br />The Free Gaza Movement would like to make it clear that we do not wish nor do we seek any confrontation with Israel. We have already invited Israeli Foreign Minister Aharon Abramovitz and Defense Minister Ehud Barak to join us on our voyage as long as they remain nonviolent. In August, we invited Tsipi Livni to accompany us. <br /><br />Mairead Maguire, the winner of the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize and one of the passengers aboard the SS Dignity, stated: &quot;The people of Gaza are part of our human family. The Israeli government cannot cut off Gaza forever. We will come again and again until we reach our family. We go to visit our family, and the Israeli government has no right to stop us.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And the servants of God most Gracious are those who walk on the earth in humility, and when the ignorant address them, they say, 'Peace!'&quot;Qur'an 25:63</p><p>Contact: Greta Berlin, Cyprus: +357 99 08 17 67Angela Godfrey Goldstein, Jerusalem: +972 547 366 393Huwaida Arraf (on boat): +357 96 723 999 /SS Dignity: +357 967 80 329Osama Qashoo, +447833381660 <br /></p><p><a href=""></a></p>
