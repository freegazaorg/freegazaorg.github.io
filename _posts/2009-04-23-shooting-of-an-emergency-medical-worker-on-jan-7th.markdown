From December 27th to January 18, Israel waged a bloody war on Gaza, killing over 1400 Palestinians and sparing no one: not women, not children, not the elderly, not medics. "One Of" reveals the shooting of an emergency medical worker on January 7th, during the period which Israel declared a 'cease-fire' period. The medics were subject to no less than 15 shots while they attempted to evacuate the body of a man already sniped by Israeli soldiers. "One Of" poses the question: how would you feel if your loved one died because ambulances were prevented from reaching the wounded. <br />{youtube}SmVWQ2KEK5M{/youtube} <br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmVWQ2KEK5M">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmVWQ2KEK5M</a>
