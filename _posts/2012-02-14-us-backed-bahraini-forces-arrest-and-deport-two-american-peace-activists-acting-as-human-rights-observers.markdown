<p>On Saturday, Bahrain arrested and deported two U.S. human rights  lawyers, Huwaida Arraf, chair of the Free Gaaz movement and Radhika Sainath, for their role in recent  protests. They were deported Sunday and returned to New York last night.  Both Arraf and Sainath are human rights lawyers and members of the  Witness Bahrain initiative, which places international observers in the  country in the hopes of preventing violence by security forces.</p>
<p>Their  arrest comes just ahead of the one-year anniversary of the popular  uprising against the U.S.-backed monarchy.</p>
