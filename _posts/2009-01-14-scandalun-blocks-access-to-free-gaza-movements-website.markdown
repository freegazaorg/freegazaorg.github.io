Inner City Press in New York found out that our website is blocked in the UN. What a scandal! "Asked why the UN would block this site, one wag quipped, so that UN staff don't go work for an organization that actually accomplishes something ... " Thanks, Inner City Press, for your investigation: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.innercitypress.com/gaza1blocked011309.html">http://www.innercitypress.com/gaza1blocked011309.html</a>
<p>Update Jan. 15: We received two emails on the matter: "Friends inside the UN say they can access the site now - I'll get further confirmation." And: I freelance for the UN and wanted to let you know that the security block on the freegaza.org site that you mention in the article has been removed. I accessed your website perfectly fine today from a UN computer." - This is good news. The question remains: how could this have happened in the first place? Isn't it more than odd? Hm.</p>
