Freedom Flotilla 2 is setting sail to Gaza soon. Despite claims that the flotilla is not needed because "Rafah is now open", the people of Gaza are<br />still trapped and suffocated by Israel's cruel blockade. Please watch this short video and share it far & wide to spread awareness about our action and why Gaza and all of Palestine needs us!<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXyR2_H0jXE" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr></wbr>v=XXyR2_H0jXE</a><br /> <br />p.s. If you're able, please consider donating to our efforts:Â <a href="en/donate" target="_blank">http://www.freegaza.<wbr></wbr>org/en/donate</a>. If you can't, no worries.
