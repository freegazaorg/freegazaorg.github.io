On August 23, 2008, for the first time in 41 years, two small wooden boats landed at the port of Gaza, Palestine. Over the next ten years, 30 boats in 18 voyages would attempt to sail there. Five of those voyages organized by the Free Gaza Movement arrived safely on those shores in 2008 before the Israeli military began to violently attack and hijack the boats, arresting passengers, stealing their possessions, and confiscating medical supplies and other humanitarian aid.  They attacked the 2010 Freedom Flotilla, murdering ten passengers on board the Mavi Marmara and injuring more than fifty on all 5 boats in that flotilla.

The story of the first voyage into Gaza and the challenges 44 passengers, and hundreds of supporters faced over the two years they organized are presented in this webinar below. Please click on the link to listen to the four organizers, Greta Berlin, Mary Hughes Thompson, Paul Larudee and Vangelis Pissias tell their story.   
You will also see three videos of how the boats were prepared, how they sailed into Gaza that momentous day, August 23, 2008, and a trailer for a new movie, Rock the Boat, directed by Kathy Sheetz, one of the videographers and passengers on board the Free Gaza.

We hope you enjoy the 90-minute story of this remarkable first trip.
