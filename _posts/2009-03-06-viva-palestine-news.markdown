We are internationals (GB, I, F, USA, CH, Jap, D...) waiting at the Rafah checkpoint with strong intention to get in to Gaza, but we are equally determined to break the siege.<br />We need your help - either by coming here or by reporting on our mission (press photos available). Today we are forty, tomorrow we will be more than hundred (the Rachel Corrie family will also be among them). The convoy is expected to arrive tomorrow, Saturday evening (the website <a href="http://www.vivapalestina.org">www.vivapalestina.org</a> says Sunday).<br />

There are plans to act in a triangle: activists also demonstrating at Erez and boats coming from Cyprus.<br />Here at Rafah we ask for more people to come to take the place of those who have to leave. Even as we or some of us can get in (as we are "promised"), our demonstration should continue until the border will be opened.<br />We have already succeeded so far as we have not been sent away. Some of us are staying here day and night, others are spending the nights at a nearby hotel.<br />For further questions please contact:<br />Amal (in close contact to vivapalestina, Egyptian and Palestinian authorities): ++20177543411<br />I will have internet access during evenings. You can also phone me: ++15204519740
