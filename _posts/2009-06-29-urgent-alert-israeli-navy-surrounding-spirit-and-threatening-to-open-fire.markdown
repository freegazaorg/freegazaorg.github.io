<span style="color: #000066;">At 1:40 am, the Israeli Navy surrounded the SPIRIT while it is on its way to the Gaza Strip. We got a call from the boat saying that they were being threatened, told to turn back or they would be fired on.</span><br style="color: #000066;" /> <br style="color: #000066;" /><span style="color: #000066;">Huwaida Arraf, one of the delegation leaders, was on the phone with the Israeli gunboats, and we could hear her saying, "You Cannot Open Fire on Unarmed Civilians" several times. At this writing, they are surrounded by several ships shining bright lights into the SPIRIT.</span><br style="color: #000066;" /> <br />CALL or FAX Major Liebovitz from the Israeli Navy at:<br /> Tel + 972 5 781 86248 or +972 3737 7777 or +972 3737 6242<br />Fax +972 3737 6123 or +972 3737 7175<br /><br />CALL Mark Regev in the Prime Minister's office at:<br />Tel +972 2670 5354 or +972 5 0620 3264<br /><a href="mailto:mark.regev@it.pmo.gov.il" target="_blank">mark.regev@it.pmo.gov.il</a><br /> <br />CALL Shlomo Dror in the Ministry of Defence at:<br />Tel +972 3697 5339 or +972 50629 8148<br /> <a href="mailto:mediasar@mod.gov.il" target="_blank">mediasar@mod.gov.il</a>
