Video 15:40 at <a href="http://dhalpin.infoaction.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=69&Itemid=15">http://dhalpin.infoaction.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=69&Itemid=15</a> Description: "The ramming of the Dignity by an Israeli gunboat with clear lethal intent at 05.30 hrs 30 December 2008, 53 miles off the Israeli coast." The Dignity, with 16 souls on board, was badly damaged. The Israeli gunboats would not let its master proceed to Gaza as he had intended. Instead it made a northerly course to Tyre in Lebanon. The 15 minute disc is made from extracts of an interview given by David Halpin of the Dove and Dolphin Charity and also from a talk given by him to the Exeter Palestine Solidarity Campaign after his return from Beirut. Along with the others on the boat, he intended to join his sisters and brothers in Gaza within the shoah that had fallen upon them 27 December with 200 people being killed in the first 15 minutes of the blitzkrieg. He was also going to represent <a href="http://www.doveanddolphin.co.uk/">http://www.doveanddolphin.co.uk/</a> and to offer his service as a doctor and surgeon should it be needed
