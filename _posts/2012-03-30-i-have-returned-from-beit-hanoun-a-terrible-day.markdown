<span style="color: #000000;">I spent the  early afternoon at a demonstration attended by several thousand people. The Hamas authorities refused to allow the people to  march to the border,Â  and clashes broke out with the police.<strong> </strong>.<br /><br />When we finally found a way to get around the Hamas  cordon, we found shabob (Kids from roughly the age of 12 to 25) at Erez  Crossing. They were throwing stones at the Israeli side of the crossing.  Tires were on fire and several kids were pulling the concertina wire  away from the crossing. Ever so often, the Israeli soldiers in the  watchtower would shoot one or two of them. So far, 1 dead, Mahmud Zakut, age 20 shot,  several in critical condition. I put down my camera to try and help with  casualties, but as each kid got shot a huge chaotic crowd formed around  them as they were rushed to motorcycles which ferried them to the  Palestinian side of the crossing and waiting ambulances.<br /><br />The rock throwing continues, the casualties will go up.
