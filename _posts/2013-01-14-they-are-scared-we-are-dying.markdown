<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">January, 2013: I’ve really tried to understand the Israelis. I used to work on a farm  in Israel. I speak Hebrew. I watch their news. All the time they talk  about fear. How they have to run to their bunkers to hide from the  rockets. How their children can’t sleep because of the sirens. This is  not a good way for them to live. <br /><br /> We Palestinians  don’t talk about fear, we talk about death. Our rockets scare them;  their rockets kill us. We have no bomb shelters, we have no sirens, we  have nowhere we can take our children and keep them safe. They are  scared. We are dying.<br /> <br /> — Mohammed al-Khoudry a Palestinian farmer in Gaza</span></span></span></p>
