For Immediate Release
<p>8am, Saturday 14th February 2009: Nine International Human Rights<br />Workers will be accompanying Palestinian farmers in Al Faraheen<br />village, east of Khan Younis. Farmers and international accompaniers<br />were fired upon by Israeli Forces in the same area on Thursday,<br />February 12th.</p>
<p>A video from 12 February of the farmers and internationals being fired<br />upon is available: http://palsolidarity.org/2009/02/5284</p>
<p>International Human Rights Activists will accompany Yusef Abu Shaheen,<br />a Palestinian farmer, in Abassan Jedida of Al Faraheen village.<br />Shaheen's land is approximately 500 metres from the 'Green Line' and 5<br />kilometres south of Kissufim (Al Qarara) Crossing.</p>
<p>"We are accompanying these farmers to harvest their crops because they<br />have a right to their land. Palestinians who live or have land within<br />1 kilometre of the Green Line are being driven out by Israeli military<br />violence. We consider this to be a form of ethnic cleansing. With<br />international accompaniment, these farmers are able to harvest their<br />crops with a much greater degree of safety than if they were to come<br />to these areas alone" Andrew Muncie (Scotland) - International Human<br />Rights Worker</p>
<p>This action comes after farm worker Anwan was shot and killed by<br />Israeli forces as he worked his land close to the 'Green Line'.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 27th January 2009, in Al Faraheen, Israeli forces shot at<br />several farmers, killing one.</p>
<p>27 year old Anwan was working picking parsley and spinach in the<br />village agricultural lands, approximately 700 m from the Green Line,<br />when Israeli jeeps opened fire with machine guns from behind the Green<br />Line - shooting more than 30 bullets in quick succession,<br />eyewitnesses reported. Many of the seven farmers working in the area<br />scattered, taking shelter from the shower of bullets. Anwan, however,<br />was shot in the neck, dying instantly.</p>
<p>Interviews with volunteers are possible.</p>
