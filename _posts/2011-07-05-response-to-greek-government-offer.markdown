<p>On Sunday 3 July the Free Gaza movement and Freedom Flotilla 2 organizers learned from media sources of an offer by the Greek Government to deliver the humanitarian cargo we have collected to Gaza. Although reports indicate that this offer was made to flotilla organizers, we have not been contacted about this, either directly or through any third party.</p>
<p>The offer, as reported, is insufficient as it shows collusion with Israel’s blockade as well as a complete disregard for Palestinian human rights, reducing the issue of Gaza and Palestine as a whole to one of humanitarian aid. However, we are willing to discuss a counter proposal with the Greek government along the lines of earlier suggestions by the Greek and Cypriot governments for a direct sea route to Gaza from one of these countries.</p>
<p>The statement referencing the offer on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website affirms the Flotilla’s position that the blockade of Gaza needs to be lifted, and that international law must be upheld.  In this regard, and if the government of Greece is serious about being helpful and not simply trying to deflect criticism from itself, we look forward to hearing from them directly. Greek government officials certainly know where to find us.</p>
