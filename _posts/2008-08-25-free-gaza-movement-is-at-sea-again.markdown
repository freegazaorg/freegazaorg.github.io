<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />FREE GAZA MOVEMENT IS AT SEA AGAIN:<br />on the 8 mile limit off Gaza Harbour &ndash;<br /><br />SS Free Gaza, with six Palestinian fishermen&rsquo;s boats, is 8-miles off the coast of Gaza, being circled by three Israeli Dabur naval vessels.&nbsp; No shots have been fired.&nbsp; The fishing boats are continuing to exercise their right to fish and have not turned round, but the Free Gaza has just now turned round (10.15 a.m.).&nbsp; The Oslo Accords allow Palestinian Gazans a 20-mile limit off the coast of the Gaza Strip.&nbsp; Currently the Navy is enforcing a 6 mile limit, so the Free Gaza Movement has broken that naval blockade, too.<br /><br />Updates from Prof. Jeff Halper on a fishing boat (not on the Free Gaza): 0542 002 642 or Huwaida Arraf also on a fishing boat:&nbsp; 0599 130 426<br /><br />Angela Godfrey-Goldstein<br /><br />Media Team<br /><br />Free Gaza Movement<br />0547-366 393<p><a href=""></a></p>
