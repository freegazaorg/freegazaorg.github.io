A report published today by Physicians for Human Rights-Israel,  “Humanitarian Minimum: Israel’s Role in Creating Food and Water  Insecurity in Gaza,” examines the effects of the Israeli blockade policy  that began in June 2007 on public health in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli  Cabinet Decision to ease restrictions on selected goods in the wake of  the flotilla and subsequent international pressure are not expected to  change this situation significantly, as they do not facilitate economic  recovery and are based on the assumption that foreign humanitarian aid  will continue.<br /> <br /> The report, which is based on testimonies and interviews with scores of  inhabitants of the Gaza Strip and key stakeholders, data from  international aid organizations and expert opinions of Israeli and  international experts, focuses on the area of nutrition and the state of  the water and sewage infrastructures. The report concludes that the  “humanitarian minimum” policy Israel has pursued since September of 2007  is significantly harming the health of Gaza residents. <br /> <br /> <strong>Summary</strong><br /> <a href="http://www.phr.org.il/default.asp?PageID=190&ItemID=995">http://www.phr.org.il/default.asp?PageID=190&ItemID=995</a> <br /> <br /> <strong>Full Report - 87 pages</strong><br /> <a href="http://www.phr.org.il/uploaded/Humanitarian%20Minimum_eng_webver_H.pdf">http://www.phr.org.il/uploaded/Humanitarian%20Minimum_eng_webver_H.pdf</a>
