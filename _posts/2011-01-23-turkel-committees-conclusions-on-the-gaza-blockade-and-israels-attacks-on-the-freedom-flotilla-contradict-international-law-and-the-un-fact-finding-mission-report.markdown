<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Once again, Israel defies international law and all common sense by issuing the first part of their Turkel Committee report, absolving itself from piracy, murder on the high seas and theft. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Below is the eloquent response from Adalah,</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (‘Justice’ in Arabic) an  independent human rights organization and legal center based in Israel.  It works to promote and defend the rights of Palestinian citizens of  Israel and Palestinians living under occupation in the OPT before  Israeli courts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">23 January 2011</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">(Haifa, Israel) Today, 23 January  2011, the Turkel Committee (the Public Commission to Examine the  Maritime Incident of 31 May 2010) issued part one of its report. It is  Adalah's position that the conclusions reached by the Turkel Committee  completely contradict international law and the findings released in  September 2010 by the International Fact-Finding Mission to Investigate  the Israeli attacks on the Flotilla, which was established by the UN  Human Rights Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The main conclusions reached by the Turkel Committee were that:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Symbol; font-size: 11pt;"><span>·<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Israel’s ‘effective control’ of the Gaza Strip ended with the disengagement [in 2005];</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Symbol; font-size: 11pt;"><span>·<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The purpose of Israel’s naval blockade on Gaza was primarily a military-security one and that it was imposed lawfully;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Symbol; font-size: 11pt;"><span>·<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Israel is complying with its humanitarian obligations towards the people of Gaza;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Symbol; font-size: 11pt;"><span>·<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The blockade does not constitute ‘collective punishment’;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Symbol; font-size: 11pt;"><span>·<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The  Israeli military?s interception and capture of the Gaza Flotilla  vessels in international waters was in conformity with international  humanitarian law;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Symbol; font-size: 11pt;"><span>·<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';"> </span></span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The  tactics and force used by the Israeli naval commandos to board the  ships and against the civilians on board was consistent with  international law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Turkel Committee’s finding  concerning the purpose of the blockade - namely that it was established  for ‘military-security’ reasons -  even contradicts statements made by  the Attorney General before the Israeli Supreme Court in the al-Basyouni  case. In this case, which involved cuts to fuel and electricity in  Gaza, the Attorney General argued that the blockade is justified as an  economic sanction taken against an enemy entity. It is part of ‘economic  warfare’ against the Hamas regime (see HCJ 9132/07, Jaber Al-Basyouni  Ahmed v. The Prime Minister; decision delivered 30 January 2008).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The principal and ultimately  devastating defect of the Turkel Committee is that it was not  independent, impartial or transparent.  The Committee’s members were  appointed by the government after being carefully selected by the Prime  Minister. Further, at least two committee members made statements prior  to the Committee’s establishment that indicate their pro-Israeli  political bias and raise serious questions about their impartiality  toward the Israeli military’s attack on the flotilla.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In addition, the Committee’s powers  and mandate were extremely circumscribed. Under Israeli law, official  commissions of inquiry have the widest investigatory powers. However,  even commissions of inquiry do not have the full powers granted to  prosecutors or the police. The powers granted to the Turkel Committee  were even less than those of an independent official commission of  inquiry. Thus, for example, the Committee was expressly prohibited from  interviewing Israeli soldiers and security officers, and consequently  relied almost exclusively on the testimonies and reports of Israeli  military and political leaders. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Thus, it did not have the tools or the  powers to open an investigation to collect evidence regarding Israel’s  interception of and attack on the flotilla in international waters,  which left nine Turkish citizens dead and dozens of other passengers  injured. The Turkel Committee did not possess the authority to  criminally indict or otherwise order the prosecution of any individual.  Finally its conclusions and recommendations are not binding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The members of the Turkel Committee  are: Justice (Ret.) Jacob Turkel, Chairman; Ambassador Professor Shabtai  Rosenne (deceased 21.9.10); General (Ret.) Amos Horev; Ambassador  Reuven Merhav; Professor Miguel Deutch; Foreign Observers: Lord David  Trimble (United Kingdom); and Brigadier General (Ret.) Kenneth Watkin,  Q.C. (Canada).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">To note, during the Flotilla events,  Adalah together with Physicians for Human Rights-Israel and the Public  Committee Against Torture in Israel filed an extraordinary petition for  habeas corpus to the Israeli Supreme Court to demand the whereabouts and  status of the Flotilla passengers. The organizations also met and took  testimonies from tens of passengers who were detained at Ela Prison in  Beer el-Sabe (Beer Sheva) and represented Muhammed Zeidan, Chair of the  High Follow-up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel; Sheikh Raed Salah,  Head of the Islamic Movement in Israel; and Sheikh Hamad Abu Daabes,  Head of the Islamic Movement in Israel (southern branch), and Ms. Lubna  Masarwa of the Free Gaza Movement following their arrest from the Mavi  Marmara. Adalah has provided legal assistance to numerous passengers  from the Flotilla in an attempt to secure the return of their personal  possessions confiscated by Israel during the attack, and to gain  compensation - and demand a criminal investigation - for one passenger  whose credit card was used by a soldier without her authorization.  Adalah and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel are also  representing MK Haneen Zoabi in a petition before the Israeli Supreme  Court challenging the Knesset’s decision to revoke several of MK Zoabi?s  parliamentary privileges due to her participation in the flotilla. The  hearing in this case is scheduled for 28 March 2011.</span></p>
