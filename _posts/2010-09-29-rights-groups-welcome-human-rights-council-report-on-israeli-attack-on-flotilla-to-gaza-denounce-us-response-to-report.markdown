<p><em><em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">September 28, 2010, New York, NY </span></span></em></em>–  Discussions at the Human Rights Council (HRC) continued today following  the release of a report of the fact-finding mission that investigated  the May 31, 2010 Israeli attacks on the flotilla of ships travelling to  Gaza, in which it found that Israel violated international law in  attacking the flotilla and by maintaining a blockade of Gaza. Nine  people were killed during the Israeli attack on the flotilla in  international waters. The <strong><strong><span>Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), </span></strong></strong>the <strong><strong><span>Free Gaza Movement (FGM),</span></strong></strong> an organizer of the flotilla, and the <strong><strong><span>National Lawyers Guild( NLG)</span></strong></strong> responded to the report and the comments made by the United States at the Council today.<span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"></span></span><br /> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">At  the HRC, the United States criticized what it termed as the report’s  “unbalanced language, tone and conclusions.”  Rather than acknowledging  the harm to the “peace process” that comes from the on-going blockade of  Gaza and the building of settlements on occupied Palestinian territory,  the U.S. urged that the report not be used to “disrupt” direct talks  between Israel and the Palestinians.</span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"></span></span><br /> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">“Unfortunately,  the United States used the opportunity of the HRC’s discussion on the  flotilla fact-finding mission's report to promote its political agenda  instead of engaging on the issue of legal accountability for Israel's  illegal blockade of Gaza and the unlawful attack on the Gaza flotilla,”  said <strong><strong><span>CCR attorney Katherine Gallagher. </span></strong></strong>"The  U.S. must recognize that there can be no peace without justice, and  that until it supports accountability for violations of international  law--even when violations committed by Israel - instead of a culture of  impunity, it lacks the legitimacy necessary to serve as a broker of  peace."</span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"></span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">“It  has always been the position of the Free Gaza Movement that when  governments fail to act, it is up to civil society to stand against  injustice,” said <strong><strong><span>Audrey Bomse</span></strong></strong><strong><strong><span>, Legal Coordinator of the Free Gaza Movement. </span></strong></strong>“The  Fact-Finding Mission rejected the notion that such intervention by  civil society is meddlesome and called for space for both humanitarian  intervention to alleviate the crisis in Gaza, and political action to  address the causes creating the crisis. The Second Freedom Flotilla now  being organized, like the one so brutally attacked by Israel, will aim  to do both. We will continue sailing until the illegal siege of 1.5  million Palestinians in Gaza is ended.”<br /></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Among its findings, the  report stated that “one of the principal motives behind the imposition  of the blockade was a desire to punish the people of the Gaza Strip for  having elected Hamas [and there is] no doubt that Israel’s actions and  policies amount to collective punishment as defined by international  law.” </span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"></span></span><br /> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The report also found:</span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"></span></span><br /> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">•     That the flotilla presented no imminent threat but the Israeli attack  was based in concerns regarding a “possible propaganda victory” of the  flotilla organizers; <br />•    That “the Israeli interception of the  flotilla was unlawful,” and “the use of force by the Israeli forces in  seizing control of the…vessels was also prima facie unlawful”; <br />•     That “much of the force used by the Israeli soldiers…was unnecessary,  disproportionate, excessive and inappropriate and resulted in the wholly  avoidable killing and maiming of a large number of civilian  passengers”; <br />•    That based in forensic evidence, at least six of  the killings [including U.S. citizen Furkhan Doğan] can be characterized  as “extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions”; <br />•    That “the  conduct of the Israeli military and other personnel towards the flotilla  passengers was not only disproportionate to the occasion but  demonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and incredible violence. It  betrayed an unacceptable level of brutality”; and <br />•    That Israel’s  confiscation of “a large amount of video and photographic footage…by  passengers, including many professional journalists… represents a  deliberate attempt by the Israeli authorities to suppress or destroy  evidence and other information” related to the flotilla attack. </span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"></span></span><br /> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">“As  a retired US Army Reserve Colonel and a former US diplomat, and as a  passenger on the Gaza flotilla, I am grateful that the UN Human Rights  Council commissioned an investigation into the Israeli military attack  on the six unarmed, civilian ships that formed the ‘Gaza flotilla,’”  said <strong><strong><span>Ann Wright, one of two US diplomats who were passengers on the Gaza flotilla. </span></strong></strong>“Despite  the passengers' notification to their respective diplomatic  representatives of criminal incidents that took place on the ships,  including murder, shootings, assaults, kidnapping on the high seas and  theft of personal property, the lack of required accountability by the  Israeli government pertaining to these crimes is outrageous. The lack of  investigation on the part of the U.S. government of the death of an  American citizen and the assaults on other American citizens by the  Israeli military is a total renunciation of the responsibilities of my  government toward its citizens.”</span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"></span></span><br /> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sixteen  U.S. citizens were part of the flotilla, five of whom were on the  U.S.-registered vessel Challenger I and one of whom was killed on the  Mavi Marmara. U.S. citizens were injured, and their property, including  computers, video and photographic equipment which contain potential  evidence for investigations, was seized and appropriated by Israel and  has not been returned.</span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"></span></span><br /> <strong><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"></span></span></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Marjorie Cohn</span></span></strong></strong><strong><strong><span>, immediate past president of the NLG, </span></strong></strong>said,  “Israel could not maintain its illegal occupation of the Palestinian  territories without the support of the United States. Three weeks after  the flotilla attack, 329 out of 435 members of the House of  Representatives and 87 out of 100 senators wrote letters to President  Obama supporting what they called Israel’s right to ‘self-defense.’  The  Human Rights Council report says unequivocally that Israel had no need  to ‘defend’ against the flotilla because it posed no imminent threat and  that Israel’s actions were illegal.”<span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"></span></span></p>
