<p>Our book,<strong> Freedom Sailors,</strong> will be released August 23, 2012. It is the inside story of our first voyage to Gaza four years ago, and how we succeeded to sail into Gaza in spite of ourselves. The book is heartwarming, sad and funny, a real adenture story and one that should be read by everyone in civil society who says these projects can't be done and won't succeed.</p>
<p>Here are just a few comments about the book:</p>
<p><strong>This is not just the story of how two tiny boats challenged the illegal Israeli siege on Gaza, but a vivid description of how a small group of people forever changed the rules of the game.A riveting account. A must read.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ramzi Baroud, <em>Palestine Chronicle</em>, Born and Raised in Gaza and Author of <em>My Father Was a Freedom Fighter</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a moving story of principled, courageous people going to the aid of the people of Gaza, whose suffering and resistance pass responsibility to all of us to take action.</strong></p>
<p><strong>John Pilger, Journalist and Filmmaker</strong></p>
<p><strong>This book MUST be read by people who care about freedom and justice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Baroness Jenny Tonge, House of Lords, UK</strong></p>

<p>People have told us that books on Palestine never sell well, that no one wants to read about Palestinians except a small number. Let's prove them wrong. After all, we proved them wrong when we sailed into Gaza the first time.</p>
