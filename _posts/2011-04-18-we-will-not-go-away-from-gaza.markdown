<strong>PRESS RELEASE: ISM COMMITTED TO STAYING IN GAZA</strong>
<p>ISM GAZA</p>
<p>Following  the murder of our comrade and friend Viktor, we, activists of the  International Solidarity Movement, would like to reiterate our  commitment to remaining in Gaza.  We will continue to work with and live among the Palestinian population as we continue the work which Vik was so committed too.</p>
<p>In  these days of mourning, Palestinians have organized numerous memorials  for Vik; they constantly remind us how sorry they are to have lost him,  of how they loved him, his closeness, his affection, and his indignation  at what is happening here in Gaza.  We know that the group that perpetrated this horrible crime does not in any way represent the Palestinian society.  The Palestinians of Gaza are our friends, our collogues, and our reason for being here; we will continue to stand by their side.</p>
<p>As  we had done when Vittorio was with us, we will continue to stand  alongside the Palestinian people, we will continue to struggle against  the occupation, we will continue to accompany farmers to their lands  along the border, we will continue to participate in demonstrations, and  we will continue to tell the world what happens here in the Gaza Strip,  Palestine.  We think that Victor would agree with Che  Guevara when he said, “Don’t cry for me if I die, do what I was doing  and I will live on in you.”  The best way to honor Vik is to continue the work that he was doing.  In particular we will soon begin crewing a boat whose mission is to monitor the violation of human rights in Palestinian waters.  This  boat will have its maiden voyage on April 20: Vik had strongly backed  this project and he had enthusiasticallyparticipated in its realization.  Vik has been an inspiration to all of us, we all hope to live up to his example.  In  a documentary about him, Vik said he would have liked to be remembered  by Nelson Mandela’s quote; “A victor is merely a dreamer who never stops  dreaming.”  Your dreams are our dreams; we will never forget you, Vik.</p>
