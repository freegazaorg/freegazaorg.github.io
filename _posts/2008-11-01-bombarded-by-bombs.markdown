We were overjoyed when our boat, SS DIGNITY, landed safely at the port of Gaza this week.&nbsp; Yesterday some of our passengers accompanied five Gazan fishing boats as they ventured out within their own territorial water in Gaza hopes of making a good catch to provide food and income for their families. &nbsp;<br /><br />While the Oslo agreement gave Gaza a 20 mile limit, the people of Gaza have never asked for more than the 12 miles which are standard under international law. After the elections in Palestine,&nbsp; Israel arbitrarily announced, as part of its blockade to punish Palestinians for democratically electing the wrong party, that it was cutting the limit to 6 miles. &nbsp;<br /><br />Since our first Free Gaza boat landed in late August, internationals have often accompanied fishermen within their own territorial waters,&nbsp; Every day Israeli gunboats with nothing better to do, menace and attack at will, using live ammunition and high-powered cannons to damage or destroy these humble boats.&nbsp; One of our human rights observers and several Palestinians have been injured.<br /><br />Yesterday we in Cyprus received repeated distress signals saying 'help, help, help, help&quot;&nbsp; from one of the boats which was under attack.&nbsp; When one of our colleagues in Israel called the Israeli military to protest, the response was &quot;They have plenty of food; why do they need to go fishing?&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />Thankfully the damaged fishing&nbsp; boat made it safely back to shore, and we have good audio and video coverage of the hours-long attack.<br /><br />We are hoping to send the SS DIGNITY back to Gaza within the next two weeks.<p><a href=""></a></p>
