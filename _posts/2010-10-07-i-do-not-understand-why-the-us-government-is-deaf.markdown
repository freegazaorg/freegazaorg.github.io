<p>Ahmet Dogan, father of Furkan Dogan has given a statement that has been attached to a letter to the U.S. State Department that will be  coming out through the Center for Constitutional Rights. Below is his heartfelt plea. The PDF of the letter is attached below.</p>
<p><span style="color: #1f497d; font-size: 11pt;"> "Up to this moment, I still do not understand why the <span>United States government</span> is deaf to what has been done to my son, an American citizen. I urge  the U.S government to act to defend the rights of my son.  I also would  like to know  why the US voted against the Gaza Flotilla Report of the  UN Fact Finding Mission at the <span>Human Rights Council</span> last week, as that report included information about the execution of my son.”</span></p>
