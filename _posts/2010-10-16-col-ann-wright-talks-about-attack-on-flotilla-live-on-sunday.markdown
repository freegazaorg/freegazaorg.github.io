<p>Free Gaza is expanding our capabilities, beginning to send out live feeds of events surrounding the run up to the next flotilla. So tune in on Sunday, October 17 at 7:30 pm California time and listen to Col. Ann Wright talk about her experience on board one of the boats attacked by Israel on May 31, then listen to plans for Freedom Flotilla 2 where we will be part of the coalition that sends 12-20 boats back to Gaza in the spring of 2011.</p>
