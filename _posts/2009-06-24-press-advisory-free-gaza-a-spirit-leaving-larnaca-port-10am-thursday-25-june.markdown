PRESS ADVISORY<br />24 June 2009<br /><br />The Free Gaza Movement will depart Larnaca Port for the Gaza Strip at 10am on Thursday 25 June. We are sending two ships, the Free Gaza and the Spirit of Humanity, with 3 tons of medical supplies, 15 tons of cement, and human rights workers and journalists from 14 countries, including Nobel laureate Mairead Maguire and former U.S. Congresswoman and presidential candidate Cynthia McKinney. This will be our first attempt to challenge Israel's naval blockade on Gaza by sea since the Israeli Navy brutally rammed our boat, DIGNITY in December, and nearly sank the SPIRIT OF HUMANITY with all on board in January.<br /> <br />We will be holding a press conference at Larnaca Port between 9am and 10am, prior to our departure.<br /><br />For more information, please contact Greta Berlin or Ramzi Kysia at +357 99 081 767, <a href="mailto:friends@freegaza.org" target="_blank">friends@freegaza.org</a>
