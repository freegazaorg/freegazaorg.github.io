<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>(Cyprus, June 3, 2010) Yesterday, the The UN Security Council called for impartial, credible investigation of the  Israeli attack on our boats. In addition, the council requested the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The media is reporting that all are being released which is simply untrue.</p>
<p>At least four Palestinian/Israelis, Free Gaza Movement board director, Lubna Masarwa, Sheik Raed Salah, leader of the northern branch of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Movement_in_Israel">Islamic Movement in Israel</a></span>, Mohammed Zeidan, Chairperson of the High Fellowship Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel and Hamed abu Dabis are facing multiple serious criminal offences for their participation in a peaceful voyage to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza.</p>
<p>After a full day in court represented by excellent attorneys from Adalah, they were remanded until June 8, evidence of how seriously the situation is for these four human rights workers.</p>
<p>This illegal incarceration is just another example of Israel’s draconian policies. First, they boarded our ships, traveling in international waters and loaded with supplies to Gaza. They murdered at least nine of our passengers, wounded dozens more, then hijacked our boats and forced them into the port of Ashdod.  They threw over 600 passengers into detention. None of these passengers had any intention of going to Israel but were dragged into the country under force and then deported.</p>
<p>Now they have thrown four well-known human rights, religious and political  leaders into prison for expressing support for their beleagured brothers and sisters in Gaza.</p>
