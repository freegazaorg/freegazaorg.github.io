<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">[April 14, 2001] Today, our friend and colleague, Vittorio Arrigoni, a  journalist and human rights defender working in the Gaza Strip, was  kidnapped by Salafists, members of a very small extremist group in Gaza.</p>
<div style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; width: 284px;">
<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em; padding: 0px 5px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><img style="float: right;" alt="Picture_1" src="images/stories/Picture_1.png" height="223" width="150" /><br style="clear: right;" /></p>

<div style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; width: 284px;"></div>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Vittorio has  been active in the Palestine cause for almost 10 years. For the past  two and a half years, he has been in Gaza with the International  Solidarity Movement, monitoring human rights violations by Israel,  supporting the Palestinian popular resistance against the Israeli  occupation and disseminating information about the situation in Gaza to  his home country of Italy. He was aboard the siege-breaking voyage in  2008 with the Free Gaza Movement and was incarcerated in Israeli prisons  several times. He was in Gaza throughout Israel’s brutal assault  (Operation Cast Lead), assisting medics and reporting to the world what  Israel was doing to the Palestinian people. He has been arrested  numerous times by Israeli forces for his participation in Palestinian  non-violent resistance in the West Bank and Gaza. His last arrest and  deportation from the area was a result of the Israeli confiscation of  Palestinian fishing vessels in Gazan territorial waters.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Vittorio frequently writes on the issue  of Palestine for the Italian newspaper, IL Manifesto and Peacereporter.  Additionally, he maintains a popular blog (<a href="http://guerrillaradio.iobloggo.com/" style="color: #c8000a; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">http://guerrillaradio.<wbr></wbr>iobloggo.com</a>) and facebook page (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Vittoriatio-Arrigoni/" style="color: #c8000a; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/<wbr></wbr>pages/Vittoriatio-Arrigoni/</a>)</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Khalil Shaheen, a friend of Vittorio  and Head of the Economic and Social Rights Department at the Palestinian  Center for Human Rights said, “This is outside of our traditions. We  are calling for the immediate release of my best friend. Vittorio  Arrigoni is a hero of Palestine. He was available everywhere to support  all the poor people, the victims. I’m calling on the local authorities  here in Gaza, and all security departments, to do their best to  guarantee his safety and immediate release.”</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Vittorio was granted honorary  citizenship for his work on promoting the cause of the Palestinian  people. Members of Gazan civil society are demanding his release;  tomorrow at 4:00pm there will be a mass demonstration in Jundi Square.</p>
