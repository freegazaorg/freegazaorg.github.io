<div>Israel Given Two Bites of the Apple</div>
<div>by AUDREY BOMSE,  <span><span>
<p><em>Co-chair of the National Lawyers Guild Free Palestine Subcommittee; she  practiced law in the US for 20 years, worked in Jerusalem and Ramallah  for six years as a human rights lawyer, and is now Legal Adviser to the  Free Gaza Movement.</em></p>

<div>
<p>Almost all the factual findings, as well as the legal analysis and  conclusions of the recently leaked UN Secretary General’s Panel of  Inquiry into the “Flotilla Incident” on May 31, 2010 (Palmer/Uribe  Panel) directly contradict those of an earlier UN report of the Human  Rights Council Fact-Finding Mission (FFM, whose conclusion that Israel’s  blockade of Gaza, including the naval blockade is illegal, was just  reaffirmed on September 13, 2011 by five independent UN rights Special  Rapporteurs. In line with all statements Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon  has made about Gaza, the Goldstone report, and statements by other  international agencies, including the International Committee of the Red  Cross (ICRC), these UN international law experts rejected the  Palmer/Uribe conclusions and demanded that “[t]he Israeli blockade of  Gaza must end immediately and the people of Gaza must be afforded  protection in line with international law.”</p>
