<div>How the IDF Targeted Civilians</div>
<div>
<p>The father of the family, Jamal Mahmoud Yassin al-Dalu, was  praying when the missile struck.  It was the afternoon of November 18<sup>th</sup>, the fifth day of the Israeli attack against Gaza misnamed “Operation Pillar of Defense”.</p>
<p>Jamal’s wife, Tahani Hassan al-Dalu, 52 was at home preparing lunch.  His grandchildren, ages 1, 4, 6, and 7 were playing with their toys,  waiting to eat.  Also in the house were Jamal’s 73 year old sister, his  two daughters, 16 and 25, his son, 29 and his son’s wife, 25. All 10  were killed at once. Three generations of a family wiped out in a single  event: five children, 4 women and the father of four of the children.</p>
