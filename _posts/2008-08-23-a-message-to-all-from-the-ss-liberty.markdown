<div>A Message to All from the SS Liberty:</div><div>&quot;We've entered Gazan waters. We're flying the Palestinian flag, and we now believe that we're going to reach the shores of Gaza very soon. I missed the start of the Berlin Wall coming down by just a few days, but now I know how people felt when they tore down those first few bricks. Today is a huge victory of people over power.&quot;</div><div>--Yvonne Ridley, abord the SS Liberty, bound for Gaza, 23 Aug. 2008</div><p><a href=""></a></p>
