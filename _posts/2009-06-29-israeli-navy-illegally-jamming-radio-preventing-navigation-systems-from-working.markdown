We just heard from the people on board the boat. The Israeli navy is jamming the radio and preventing navigation systems from working. This action is in direct violation of International and Maritime law.<br /><br />If anything happens to the boat or its passengers, it will be the direct result of Israel's aggressive response to a civilian boat taking unarmed passengers to Gaza. The Free Gaza Movement holds the government of Israel responsible for the safety and security of the passengers on board the SPIRIT.Â  <br /> <br />We would like to emphasize that the boat is in international waters, and, as such, falls under the protection of international law.<br /><br />Call, fax and email:<br clear="all" />
