<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">(18th February, 2009) </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">What caused the Israeli soldiers to shoot a deaf farmer today? Was he threatening? Was it because the group of farm labourers had successfully worked quickly to harvest their day’s wages? Was the sight of retreating, unarmed, clearly non-threatening civilians too tempting to resist?</span></p>

The bullet which targeted his ankle penetrated straight through and landed in the tire of the truck he’d been pushing.</span></p>

We started to run away. They shot again.”</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>

<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">“We had stopped our work and were ready to leave. The truck wasn’t starting. We were pushing the pickup truck. The Israeli soldiers started shooting at us from the border area. Mohammed was hit in the leg. I carried him about 2 metres before they started shooting again. We were able to get him to a truck on the road, which took him towards the town. An ambulance picked him up from the truck and took him to Nasser hospital in Khan Younis.”</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Samoud attests there was quiet before the Israeli soldiers shot al-Buraim. “There weren’t any (Palestinian) fighters, there was nothing happening except for us farming. We work because we need to. We get 20 shekels a day, it isn’t a lot, but it’s the only work we can get.”</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">It was 18 February approximately 10:15 am and farmers were leaving the land they’d harvested, roughly 500 m from the Green Line. The lightly-dressed, unarmed farmers were clearly visible to and seen by the several Israeli army jeeps and the Hummer which had patrolled the border fence, stopping for long intervals to watch the farmers work, then moving on.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The farmers’ proximity to the border fence was more than off-set by the very visible nature of their work and of all present, including the 5 international human rights workers wearing bright vests and using a megaphone. The farmers’ tools are a kitchen knife slightly sharper than one used for eating, binding cord, and donkey carts or pickup trucks to haul away the harvest.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Before the shooting occurred, the Hummer sat directly across from the working farmers for over 30 minutes, observing. There was no threat from the farmers who glanced worriedly at the vehicle from time to time but otherwise kept swiftly working. Israeli soldiers inside the vehicle would have had no problem seeing the actions of the farmers cutting and binding spinach and parsley, and loading it into the back of a small pickup truck. The farmers finished for the morning, packed the truck, and attempted to leave. Still unarmed.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The Israeli soldiers shot at the sides and backs of unarmed farmers pushing their pickup truck which had stalled. Even after al-Buraim had been hit, the shooting continued although the snipers would have been able to see that someone had been shot.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The firing continued as the farmers, surrounded by international human rights observers, walked away from the field and took shelter behind a nearby house, reaching it at around 10:30 am. Israeli soldiers continued to shoot at the farmers and internationals taking cover, for a period increasing their shots to every 5 seconds, with that unmistakably close “pftzzzz” of the bullets whizzing past.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">After time, internationals evacuated farmers in 2 groups, again surrounding them as we walked, wary of the sniper’s abilities.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Given that the soldiers were shooting at the backs of retreating, unarmed, farmers and internationals, the pretext of ‘defending the border’ or Israeli soldiers’ having felt ‘threatened’ becomes blindingly transparent.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">There was no shooting from the Palestinian side, no threat, no reason to shoot, other than malevolence. The farmers were clearly involved in the task of working the land, and the internationals accompanying them were visibly and audibly recognizable.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">U.K.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> citizen Jenny Linnel also present during the shooting said: “The farmers were in the process of leaving when the IOF shot. And the IOF continued to shoot as the farmers tried to leave, continued to shoot, sniper-style, as the farmers cowered for cover. It was aggression for the sake of aggression.”</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The life of a farmer is never easy, and is all the more difficult for farmers in the “buffer zone,” the band of land which has been imposed and extended arbitrarily to 1 km from the Green Line (on the Gaza side, not the Israeli side) by the occupying force which insists it has ‘withdrawn from Gaza’ [yet somehow controls borders, imports and exports, and the entry of humanitarian aid (entry denied), and which can impose no-go zones in a land not its own, for its ‘safety' (as with the separation wall cutting deeply into the west bank and carving the occupied land into smaller, militarily-controlled, chunks, the imposition of a "buffer zone" on Palestinian land in Gaza begs the question: if Israel is erecting the Wall and imposing no-go zones out of safety concerns, why not do so on Israeli land?)].</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Were farming merely made difficult due to the ban of seeds and fertilizers into Gaza, as well as the ban on machinery replacement parts (extended to hospital equipment replacement parts, and replacement parts for basically anything that breaks down in Gaza), people could perhaps get on with it. But with Israeli soldiers’ near-daily shooting on Palestinians living on, working on, their land in an arbitrarily confiscated zone, then farming becomes seriously problematic.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Ironically, as we near-daily accompany farmers in these troubled ‘buffer zone’ regions, vigilantly keeping watch of the many jeeps scurrying to and fro and taking long pauses parked directly across from wherever we are farming, we see unhindered farming activity on the Israeli side: crop-dusters circle in wide arcs, tending the plots below with chemicals and planes unavailable to Gaza; tractors plow the land…in broad daylight! At a leisurely, unworried pace!</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Back in the Gaza prison, farmers struggle with broken trucks, hand-harvesting, and an obstacle course of bullets.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Israeli soldiers have made a regular practice of targeting civilians, including farmers, in the arbitrarily-imposed “buffer zone,” a practice that continued throughout and despite the June 19 ceasefire.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">And while the demeanor of the farmers makes it evident that they are accustomed to being shot at, they are nonetheless clearly afraid. Until this close call, their need to work the land had overridden fear for their lives. A sort of resigned determination seemed to guide them, along with the adage, “<em>hek iddiny</em>a,”(”This is our life”), explaining in words and gestures that they have little option but to continue working the land, for the produce itself or for a mere 20 shekels a day.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Yet, Abu Alaa says they will not go back to the fields any time soon. “How can we go back? Its too much now, too dangerous. We will wait until it feels calmer.”</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">From his hospital bed, charismatic and likeable Mohammed al-Buraim, assures that he’ll be okay, even after the assault. But no way will he go near the field. “You think I’m crazy?!” he signs.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The shot was so near. It could have taken his life. Just a few feet up…just a slightly slower, slightly faster reaction… it was close.  They were close to again killing an impoverished farm-worker.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">On 27 January, in the same area, IOF soldiers killed 27 year old Anwar Zayed al-Buraim, shooting him in the neck while he picked vegetables on land approximately 600 metres from the Green Line. Anwar was Mohammed’s cousin.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">These fertile rural eastern border areas of the Gaza Strip are emptying, because farmers, many of whom have farmed here for generations, are now too frightened to live and work on their own land. The confines of the Gaza Strip, which is just forty kilometers long and ten kilometers wide, are being shrunk even further by relentless Israeli invasions, by the imposition of an arbitrary and expanding “buffer zone” and by the targeting of civilians and farmers trying to live on and earn a living from their land.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Mohammed al-Buraim marks the fourth shooting of Palestinians in the ‘buffer zone’ in the last few weeks.  The three shootings prior to Mohammed’s were: on 18 January, Maher Abu-Rajileh (24), from Huza’ah village, east of Khan Younis, was killed by IOF soldiers while working on his land 400m from the Green Line; on 20 January, at 1 pm, Israeli soldiers shot Waleed al-Astal (42) of Al Qarara, near Khan Younis, in his right foot; and on 27 January, Anwar al-Buraim was shot in the neck and killed.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">While attacks on farmers in other border communities, especially those on the Israeli side, would not go unnoticed, somehow the international community remains silent about these deaths, injuries, and breaches of international law.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Just as the international community has stooped silently complicit to the siege on Gaza which has denied Palestinians of every conceivable means of existence and livelihood, so too are international leaders silent to the oppression of the farmers and fishermen, the poorest and the bravest, facing Israeli fire and ending up like Mohammed, Anwar, or 23 year old Rafiq who was targeted 2 miles off Gaza’s coast while in a small fishing boat. Israeli soldiers sprayed the boat with bullets, the ‘dum-dum- exploding bullets hitting Rafiq in the back and exploding into numerous tiny shrapnel pieces which pierced his lungs and remain dangerously close to his spine, impossible to remove.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; direction: ltr; line-height: 14.4pt; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>

They are part of the policy of cutting off any means of self-sufficiency the Palestinians try to engage in, and of continuing in the efforts to break Palestinians’ will, efforts which have included a years-long, brutal siege, a 23 day bloody war killing over 1370 Palestinians, and the ongoing targeting of civilians throughout the Gaza Strip.</span></p>
