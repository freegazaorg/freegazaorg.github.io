<p>Since November 22, 2012, <strong>4 Palestinians have been killed and 75 Palestinians, including 14 children have been wounded by IOF fire in Gaza Strip.</strong></p>
<p>One of the wounded is a fisherman shot in the sea, while the others are protesters, workers and farmers shot in the areas close to the fence of the Green Line.  The data is from <a href="http://www.pchrgaza.org/portal/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=84&Itemid=183">PCHR weekly reports</a>, unless otherwise mentioned. In almost all the cases, the victims are mentioned expressly as civilians.   This is not a complete list of Israeli violations of the ceasefire, as it contains only the incidents which resulted in injuries or deaths.</p>
