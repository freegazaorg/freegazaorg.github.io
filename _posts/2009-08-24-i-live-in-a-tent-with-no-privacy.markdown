<p>Gaza, August 23, 2009, (Pal Telegraph) - Every time she tries to understand what happened to her, she asks herself : what was my fault? What's going to happen to me in my tent?</p>
<p>Ilham, a 30-year-old mother of 6, lives in Al-Atatra district, in the northern part of the Gaza strip. The Israeli war had a huge impact on her; it destroyed her house, her parent's house and killed her brother.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Ilham and her family spent 25 days in one of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's schools (UNRWA), to take shelter from phosphorous missiles of death that were chasing the population of the strip.</p>
<p>This is her story: <a title="live in a tent" href="http://www.paltelegraph.com/palestine/gaza-strip/1955-i-live-in-a-tent-with-no-privacy">http://www.paltelegraph.com/palestine/gaza-strip/1955-i-live-in-a-tent-with-no-privacy</a></p>
