<p>Today, Wednesday 31st March, the <a href="http://www.allvoices.com/s/event-5512862/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mcmVlZ2F6YS5vcmc=" rel="external nofollow">Free Gaza Movement</a>, a human rights organisation which has successfully sent a number of boats into Gaza through the Israeli naval blockade, announced that it had bought a 1200 tonne cargo ship at an auction in Dundalk, Ireland.</p>
<p>The vessel had been impounded a year ago following an inspection by the International Transport Federation (ITF) which found that its owners had exploited their Lithuanian crew members - not paying their wages and subjecting them to humiliating treatment.</p>
