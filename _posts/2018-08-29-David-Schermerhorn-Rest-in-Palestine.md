It is with immense heartache that we are writing to tell you that our father, David Ker Schermerhorn, died on Monday August 27th at age 89 – he was surrounded by family.  

David lived a full and adventurous life right up until the bitter end. Over the past few months, he had gone skydiving as a tribute to the people of Gaza and their Right of Return, marched in anti-Trump rallies, tended bees, traveled to Mexico, and to Alaska with my daughter and me so we could see the Northern Lights together.  He was in the midst of directing his first film, a short documentary about an 80 year old trapper in Shasta County. 

David was a lover of life, learning, laughter, adventure, the outdoors, and family, and was driven by a sense of curiosity, moral duty, and  a responsibility to his fellow man.  He lived by the words of his dear friend, ACLU founder, Roger Baldwin, who told him that you must ‘never lose your sense of wonder.’ 

In continuing with David's legacy, we ask that friends commit to one new adventure in this coming year– this will continue on his legacy of adventure and wonder. Donations can also be made in David's memory to https://www.mecaforpeace.org/

A memorial will be held later this year, details will be forthcoming.

With sadness, yet immense gratitude, Stay Human
