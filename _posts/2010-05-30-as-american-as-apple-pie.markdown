<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>(Cyprus, May 30, 2010) The Free Gaza Movement now has two boats included in the Freedom Flotilla that is on its way to deliver 10,000 tons of supplies to the imprisoned people of Gaza. The third boat is being repaired.</p>
<p>Our two passengers boats, Challenger 1 and Challenger 1I, had mechanical problems on Friday, May 28, and were pulled into ports in Cyprus. After Cypriot port authoriies on the Greek side denied our request to pull in for repairs, our boat, Challenger 1 limped into the port of Famagusta, on the Turkish side of Cyprus.</p>
<p>Both boats are flagged and registered in the United States, which means they are U.S. territory.</p>
<p>Therefore we expect the U.S. government to intervene if U.S. property is wrongly confiscated by Israeli authorities as they have threatened. Israel has yet to return the Spriit of Humanity, registered under a Greek flag.</p>
<p>Please contact the American State Department and ask them what their plans are in case this happens. They can be contacted at <strong>Telephone No. (202) 647-4000 (24-hour number)</strong> or <strong> </strong><a href="mailto:publicaffairs@panet.us.state.gov">publicaffairs@panet.us.state.gov</a>.</p>
