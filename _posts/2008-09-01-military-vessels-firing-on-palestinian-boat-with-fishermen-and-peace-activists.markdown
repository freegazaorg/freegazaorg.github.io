<p>At 9:45 am (CEST) news came in that several Israeli vessels are firing on a Palestinian fishing boat with six &quot;Free Gaza&quot; peace activists on board. The activists called from the boat. On the other end in Cyprus the gunfire was said to be audible in the background. The boat had gone out fishing this dawn, the passengers are unarmed and in Gazan waters. The international peace activists on board are George from Greece, Donna and Darlene (USA), Adam from Denmark, Andrew from Scotland and Vik from Italy. Inform your embassies, more news follow.
