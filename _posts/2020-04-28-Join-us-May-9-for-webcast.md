On May 9, the co-founders of the Free Gaza movement as well as moderator, Ann Wright will participate in a 90-minute webcast on "How Did We Ever Manage to Sail To Gaza? No Social Media... Only Email and Committed Activists." This is a webcast on how to start a movement and what others can learn from us. 

Join us. We will update time and provide a sign-in on ZOOM as we get closer to the date. Below is one of the pieces from **Musheir Al-Fara**, the only Palestinian onboard our two boats who comes from Gaza. It is in our book, Freedom Sailors, [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15993465-freedom-sailors](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15993465-freedom-sailors)

As Gaza started to appear on the horizon, I felt ecstatic; I just could not believe it. I never expected it. After all the threats, I thought we would end up in an Israeli prison. I could not stop my tears. At last, I will be able to visit my mother, Laila’s grave. Laila who always said to people around her, even when she was in good health, “If I die, please tell Musheir that the last words on my lips were his name.” Yet I couldn’t be at her bedside when she was dying the hospital where I was born, because of this inhuman and illegitimate siege. My tears continued. Greta was standing next to me. She hugged me, and, in a very emotional voice said, “Musheir, these moments can never be taken away from us.”
     
As we neared the coast, Derek, one of our colleagues, came to me asking to contact the Gaza Port authorities to seek permission to enter Gaza’s territorial waters.  No ships had docked in Gaza Port since 1967, so the port authorities did not know how to guide us.  By then I could see Gaza clearly.  I erupted: “No need, there is the Beach Camp, there is Omar Al Mukhtar Street.  I can see Al Shohada Street.  The port is there, right in front of us.”  
     
We continued towards the port until our dream came true.  We had reached Gaza against all the odds.
Without a doubt our arrival was a breath of freedom and hope for the people of the Gaza strip.  The thousands waiting for us, every one in the Gaza Strip, felt a sense of pride during those euphoric moments.  It was a feeling of dignity that comes from defiance when much of the world, including Arab regimes, turns a blind eye to the Palestinians’ suffering. Even if we had only achieved a few moments of triumph for the people, this would have been a good enough cause. 
     
On the morning that the Break the Siege boats were due to depart from Gaza port, I woke up very early. I went to Khan Younis cemetery with my colleague, Fathi Jouadi, to visit my mother’s grave. It was the first time I had visited the grave. I spontaneously found myself talking to my mother. I could not stop my tears, saying, 
  
  __“Mother, I am here. I am visiting you despite their siege.” I used to joke with my mother. “Do not die when I cannot be with you.” She would laugh and say, “Don’t worry, I will not if you promise to place me in my grave with your own hands.” I had promised to do that, but was unable to.
     It was a great feeling, a feeling of freedom that I had never experienced. It was the first time in my life that I had visited home without the humiliation of being questioned or interrogated by the Israelis, without being threatened, having my travel documents thrown in my face, and not knowing whether I would be able to get out or not. It is a sense of liberation I hope every Palestinian will experience one day. I am proud of being one of the first Palestinians from the Occupied Territories to enter Palestine without Israeli permission since 1967."
