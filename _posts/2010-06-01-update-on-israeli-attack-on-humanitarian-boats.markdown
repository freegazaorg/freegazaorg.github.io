<h2>[Cyprus – 1 June, 2010] The UN Security Council Calls for Impartial, Credible Investigation of Israeli Boat Raid. The raid in international waters, on the aid convoy headed to Gaza left at least 16 civilians dead. After an emergency session wrapped up in the early hours this morning, the council agreed to language condemning the acts that resulted in the deaths and injuries aboard the Turkish vessel <em>Mavi Marmara</em> and the European Campaign’s vessel <em>Spendoni</em>.</h2>
<h2>The Council requested the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel.</h2>
<h2>The council called for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards. The council statement also reemphasized the importance of implementing U.N. resolution 1860, which calls for the unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance to Gaza's 1.5 million residents.  The flow of aid has been severely hampered by Israel's three-year blockade on the Gaza Strip.</h2>
<h2>Yesterday, Israeli-licensed attorneys filed two habeas briefs: one is asking for to release the passengers and the boats, so we can continue on our way to Gaza, since it was illegal to stop us in international waters. The other one is asking for information on all of the passengers, because there has been a total blackout on where the passengers are, who was wounded and who was murdered.</h2>
<h2>Lawyers are only being allowed access for three hours every day from 13:00-16:30. They have the names of three Palestinians still in detention: Sheik Salah, Mohammad Zeidan and Lubna Marsawa.</h2>
<h2>Knesset Member Hanin Zoabi (Balad) who participated in the international flotilla to the Gaza Strip said, "It was clear from the size of the force that boarded the ship that the purpose was not only to stop this sail, but to cause the largest possible number of fatalities in order to stop such initiatives in the future." http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3897360,00.html</h2>
