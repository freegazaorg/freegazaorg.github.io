<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><em>Compare the Estelle         to one of the Israeli warships that may attack it<br /> <br /> </em></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> ”Estelle is       a steel-hulled 53-metre ship originally (1922) built  for North Sea       trawl fishing. Before being converted into a Fair  Trade vessel in       the 1980s, she spent about fifteen years hauling  gravel from       Vuolahti to Helsinki. In 2012 the Estelle was sold to  Ship to Gaza       Sweden for an attempt to break and lift the Gaza  blockade.” <br /> (Quotation from Estelle´s web page: <a href="http://www.estelle.fi/en/estelle" target="_blank">http://www.estelle.fi/en/<wbr></wbr>estelle</a>)<br /> <br /> ”The Protector is an integrated naval combat system, based on        unmanned, autonomous, remotely controlled surface vehicles. Highly        maneuverable and stealthy, the Protector can conduct a wide        spectrum of critical missions, without exposing personnel and        capital assets to unnecessary risk. <br /> The Protector's anti-terror  mission module payload includes       sensors and weapon systems. The  search radar and the Toplite       electro-optical (EO) pod enable  detection, identification and       targeting operations. The weapon  systems are based on Rafael's       Typhoon remote-controlled,  stabilized weapon station, capable of       operating various small  caliber guns. The highly accurate,       stabilized weapon station has  excellent hit-and-kill probability.”       According to Jerusalem Post,  the purpose of the Protector is       ”stopping Palestinian fisherman  from sailing outside their       permitted area or preventing flotillas  from sailing to the Gaza       Strip”.<br /> (Quotation from the Israeli weapon company Rafael´s web page: <a href="http://www.rafael.co.il/Marketing/288-1037-en/Marketing.aspx?searchText=protector" target="_blank">http://www.rafael.co.il/<wbr></wbr>Marketing/288-1037-en/<wbr></wbr>Marketing.aspx?searchText=<wbr></wbr>protector</a>)</span>
