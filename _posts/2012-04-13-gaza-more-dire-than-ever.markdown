During the Israeli “Operation Cast Lead” in Dec. 2008 – Jan. 2009,   Dr. Gilbert was one of only two outside doctors in Gaza. Last week the   International Criminal Court, to the protests of Amnesty International   and other groups, stated it would not issue prosecutions for the Israeli   Operation. Recently Gilbert, co-author of “Eyes in Gaza,” returned to   Gaza and is now on a 10-day speaking tour in the U.S.
<p>Gilbert said today: “The Israeli Operation Cast Lead killed 1.400   people in Gaza, struck 58 mosques and 280 schools. I’m sad to say from   my visit to Gaza earlier this year, the situation is now more dire than   ever. The Israeli siege effectively prohibits the rebuilding of Gaza —   the import of concrete, of window panes, the availability of travel for   medical care for the population. I’ve worked in other desperate   situations in other places and Gaza is unique in a number of respects.   It’s a captive population — usually if civilians are being attacked,   there’s a safe place they can take refuge and then come back to their   homes when the fighting has stopped. That doesn’t exist for the people   in Gaza since they are effectively imprisoned by the Israeli siege. It’s   an incredibly young population and a very poor population with nearly   80 percent unemployment, largely because of the Israeli siege, which is   an illegal form of collective punishment. Anemia and protein  deficiency  are widespread.</p>
