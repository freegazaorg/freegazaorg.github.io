<p>I had expected conditions in Gaza to be bad, but I was still shocked at the devastation when I went there in July. Last month my companion and I entered Gaza at the Erez crossing through a modern building reminiscent of an airport terminal. After questioning by the Israeli border police, we left the building and had a kilometre walk to pick up transportation. It was as if we had travelled to another planet. <a href="http://www.thespec.com/printArticle/418302" target="_blank" /></p><p><a href="http://www.thespec.com/printArticle/418302" target="_blank" /></p><p><a href="http://www.thespec.com/printArticle/418302">http://www.thespec.com/printArticle/418302</a></p>
