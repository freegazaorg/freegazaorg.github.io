<p>A group calling itself U.S. Boat to Gaza is seeking $370,000 in the next  month to send an aid ship to the Gaza Strip that would be named after  President Obama's best-selling book "The Audacity of Hope."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/20/AR2010072006108.html" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/<wbr></wbr>wp-dyn/content/article/2010/<wbr></wbr>07/20/AR2010072006108.html</a></p>
<p>Rashid Khalidi, a friend of Obama who is active in Palestinian causes,  has signed the appeal, part of a broader effort to thwart the Israeli  blockade of the Hamas-controlled Palestinian enclave.</p>
<p>(A second longer article with video is here at the New York Times <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/american-activists-plan-gaza-flotilla-ship-named-for-obama-book/">http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/american-activists-plan-gaza-flotilla-ship-named-for-obama-book/</a> )</p>
<p>Khalidi, a Columbia University professor, briefly became the subject of  controversy during the 2008 presidential campaign when Sen. John  McCain's camp tried to make an issue of what it called Obama's suspect  friendships. The news of Khalidi's involvement in the boat appeal has  led the National Review to call for a Justice Department probe of the  academic on grounds he may have provided material support to a terrorist  group.</p>
<p>The White House declined to comment. Khalidi said he was not aware the  boat would be named after Obama's book when he agreed to add his name to  the list of sponsors.</p>
<p>"But if the name is a problem for the administration, it can simply  insist publicly that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/countries/israel.html?nav=el">Israel</a> lift the siege: end of problem, end of  embarrassment," he wrote in an e-mail.</p>
