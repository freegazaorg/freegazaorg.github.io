Abstract: A group of activists arrested after the Israeli navy seized an aid ship bound for the devastated Gaza Strip were expelled from Israel on Friday, a day after being detained by the military. Fifteen of the Togolese-flagged Tali's crew members were deported back to Lebanon and Syria early on Friday, and three others were preparing to fly to London.  <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?article_ID=99193&categ_ID=1&edition_id=1">http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?article_ID=99193&categ_ID=1&edition_id=1</a>   <br />
