PRESS RELEASE - 8th December 2008<br />For immediate release<br /><br />BRITISH ACADEMICS TO BREAK THE SIEGE OF GAZA:<br />BOAT LEAVES CYPRUS TO IMPLEMENT 'RIGHT TO STUDY' OF PALESTINIAN STUDENTS<br /><br />Two Jewish academics from the UK, Emeritus Professor Jonathan Rosenhead<br />and Research Fellow Mike Cushman, both from the Department of Management<br />at the London School of Economics, have joined the latest 'Free Gaza' boat<br />in an attempt to enable Palestinian university students to pursue their<br />studies abroad.<br /><br />The 'Dignity' sailed from Larnaca, Cyprus at 23.40 local time, Monday<br />December 8, in an effort to break Israel's 19-month blockade of Gaza and<br />bring out 16 students who have places to study abroad.&nbsp; There are<br />currently some 1700 students in Gaza who have been granted places at<br />universities abroad - often with prestigious scholarships such as the<br />Fulbright or Ford Foundation awards - but whom the Israeli authorities<br />have prevented from leaving Gaza.<br /><br />Higher education opportunities are extremely limited in Gaza.&nbsp; Many vital<br />disciplines, including speech therapy, dentistry and physical therapy are<br />not taught in Gaza, and there is no opportunity for doctoral study either<br />in Gaza or in the West Bank.&nbsp; Study abroad is the only alternative for<br />Palestinian students, yet this alternative is being denied them by the<br />Israeli authorities.<br /><br />Rosenhead and Cushman are members of the British Committee for the<br />Universities of Palestine (BRICUP), which advocates boycotting Israeli<br />academic institutions as long as they are complicit in Israel's illegal<br />occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territory. BRICUP recently held a<br />packed meeting at SOAS where Israeli academic Prof. Ilan Pappe described<br />the Israeli siege of Gaza as &quot;slow genocide&quot;.<br /><br />Now they have joined those taking direct action to enable Palestinian<br />students to continue their academic and professional training.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof.<br />Rosenhead said: &quot;Our government has failed to uphold international law and<br />defend the human rights of the Palestinians, including the right to study<br />and the right to teach. On the 60th anniversary of the International<br />Declaration of Human Rights, we are proud to join the 'Dignity' on its<br />fourth blockade-breaking trip to Gaza.&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope that by the end of this<br />week we will have liberated these Palestinian students, in accordance with<br />international law, and enabled them to take up the places&nbsp; awarded them by<br />universities around the world in recognition of their academic merit.&quot;<br /><br />Mr. Cushman said: &quot;As academics we are particularly pleased to be<br />travelling on the Dignity on this mission to enable at least some of the<br />hundreds of students trapped in Gaza by the Israeli siege to get out and<br />take up their places at universities round the world. This siege is an<br />affront to any idea of academic freedom or human rights. We, working for a<br />British university, have the freedom to teach and study.&nbsp; This must be a<br />universal right, not at the discretion of an occupying power. How can<br />anyone justify preventing young people from fulfilling their potential and<br />learning how to serve their community more fully?&quot;<br /><br />This third trip by the 'Dignity' is expected to take 14 hours, arriving in<br />Gaza on Tuesday 9th December at 13.30 local time (11.30 GMT).<br /><br />[ ends ]<br /><br />Notes to editors<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 'Dignity' is at sea right now.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can try ringing Mike Cushman<br />on board the 'Dignity' on +44 773 670 5294, but it may be out of range.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BRICUP contact in the UK: Sue Blackwell, 0792 995 3893.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relevant websites for further information:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.letkhaledstudy.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.letkhaledstudy.co.uk/</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (for info on trapped Palestinian students in Gaza)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.freegaza.org/ (Free Gaza boats campaign)<br /><a href="http://www.freegaza.org/index.php?module=latest_news&id=41cadce39691c2458068c725561a1e25&offset=" target="_blank">http://www.freegaza.org/index.php?module=latest_news&amp;id=41cadce39691c2458068c725561a1e25&amp;offset=</a><br />(Free Gaza movement's own press release)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.bricup.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.bricup.org.uk</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (academic &amp; cultural boycott of Israel - UK)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.pacbi.org/" target="_blank">www.pacbi.org </a>(academic &amp; cultural boycott of Israel - Palestine) <br /><p><a href=""></a></p>
