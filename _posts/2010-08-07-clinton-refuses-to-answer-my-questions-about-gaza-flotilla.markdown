</a> Dear Secretary of State Clinton,<br /> <br /> I am a retired US Army reserve colonel with 29 years in the US Army and  Army Reserves, and a former US diplomat who resigned after 16 years in  the US State Department in opposition to the war on Iraq.<br /> <br /> I was one of fourteen American citizens on the Gaza flotilla.<br /> <br /> On June 14, 2010, I delivered to the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office  of American Citizen Services a letter to you requesting investigation of  the Israeli attack on the Gaza flotilla in which one unarmed American  citizen was killed by Israeli commandos and fourteen other American  citizens were kidnapped from international waters and taken to Israel  against their will, imprisoned, and their personal possessions stolen by  Israeli commandos.</p>
