Free Gaza Movement Boat Flotilla in Need of Immediate Assistance (23.08.08) Free Gaza Movement Boat Flotilla in Need of Immediate Assistance <br />&nbsp; <br />The two, Free Gaza Movement boats, SS Liberty and SS Free Gaza, are now sailing with damaged navigation systems. As such, they are in jeopardy of drifting off course and out of international waters.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />In addition they have encountering rough seas, with waves over 3 metre's high.&nbsp; Many of the older passengers on board are suffering from serious sea sickness. For some of them these conditions could pose life-threatening health risks.<br />&nbsp;<br />Their navigation systems have been damaged and as such they are in jeopardy of drifting unknowingly out of international waters.<br />&nbsp;<br />We request that all individuals and organisations make representation to the government of Israel and the Israeli navy to protect the lives of the civilians aboard the two ships, SS Liberty and SS Free Gaza which are sailing under the Greek flag.<br />&nbsp;<br />For More Information Contact:<br />&nbsp;<br />Angela Godfrey-Goldstein<br />Tel. +972 547 366 393&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />or<br />Osama Qashoo<br />+44 78 333 81660&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />+44 79 779 3595<p><a href=""></a></p>
