<p>The Free Gaza Movement is proud to announce strong support from the people of Malaysia for its efforts to break the siege on Gaza. On Wednesday, August 12, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, former Prime Minister of Malaysia and Chairman of the Perdana Global Peace Organisation announced the establishment of the Gaza Fund, which will raise money for the Free Gaza Movement’s efforts to challenge Israel’s illegal blockade and collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza. He asked other Malaysians to join with him in raising the money for this endeavor.</p>

<p>Also present at the press conference was his wife, Tun Dr Siti Hasmah Mohd Ali as well as chairperson of the Free Gaza Movement, Huwaida Arraf. Huwaida said the Free Gaza Movement’s next mission to Gaza will likely be in early October before the winter season.</p>
<p>A number of prominent Malaysian businessmen were present at the press conference and pledged financial support. Tun Dr Mahathir also announced support from Malaysia’s First Lady, Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, who had met with Free Gaza Movement representatives on the previous day.</p>
<p>The money collected will be used to purchase a cargo ship and building supplies for the beleaguered Palestinians who lost their homes, hospitals and schools in Israel's brutal military assault against them last winter. Although donor countries have pledged over $4.2 billion for the reconstruction of Gaza, Israel refuses to allow building supplies to enter the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>“Countries have the obligation to help the Palestinian people who are suffering and assist to stop the Israeli sea blockade,” he said. “We want to send building materials. We need to rebuild the houses, because Palestinians are now living in tents and when winter comes, it will be terrible for the old, sick and children.</p>
<p>The Free Gaza Movement gratefully thanks Tun Dr. Mahathir, Datin Rosmah, and the people of Malaysia for their support. We are thrilled begin raising money for  two to four passenger boats to accompany the cargo ship on its voyage in October.</p>
