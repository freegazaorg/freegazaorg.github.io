<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>PENGO, Stop the Wall Campaign </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>and the Free Gaza Movement</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Call for Internationals to come to Gaza</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We are urging internationals to come to Gaza as human rights defenders and solidarity activists and to bear witness to the Israeli crimes against a civilian population trapped in an open-air prison with nowhere to hide, pounded by Israeli drones, F-16s, helicopters and missiles. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We are asking you to begin to come on Sunday, November 25, 2012.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Since the United Nations, governments and other international institutions have failed to fulfill their obligation to protect the besieged civilians of Gaza and stop the Israeli aggression, we urge people of conscience to come to Gaza to speak out about the Israeli war crimes and possible crimes against humanity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">During <ins cite="mailto:audreyb0" datetime="2012-11-20T17:29">t</ins>he last attack on Gaza in 2008-2009, Egypt closed Rafah borders and no one could get in to document the Israeli crimes. This time, the Rafah borders appear to be open. <ins cite="mailto:Greta%20Hughes" datetime="2012-11-21T07:32"></ins>We need your support to raise our voice among the international community.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Since Israel began attacking the people of Gaza seven days ago, 138 people have been murdered, including 23 children and 1050 injured. More are being murdered as you read this call.  Abandoned by the UN and most state governments despite their obligation under international law, we call on civil society to enter Gaza to act as witnesses to the brutality of the Israeli attacks on the imprisoned population in Gaza and show the people of Gaza they are not alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yesterday, 31 civilians were killed while Israel refused to consider the terms of the ceasefire. In addition, bombing of houses and mosques and businesses continued. Even if the parties get a ceasefire agreement in the coming days, it is important to go and show your support, bear witness to what is happening to the people of Gaza and be an extra pair of hands and eyes, however you can help.</span></p>
