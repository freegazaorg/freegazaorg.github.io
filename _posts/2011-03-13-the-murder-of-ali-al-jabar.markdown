<p>Ali Al-Jabar was the cameraman for Al Jazeera and a passenger on board our second voyage to break Israel's illegal blockade of Gaza. He was funny, full of life and a passionate advocate for justice for the Palestinians.</p>

<p>He died as he lived, filming the war zone in Libya and was probably in the middle of the conflict carefully documenting what was happening. The link below from Huffington Post describes what happaned.</p>

<p>May he rest in peace and may his family know how grateful all of us at Free Gaza are for his contribution to justice.</p>
