FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Rafa, Gaza, February 22, 2021: The initiative to raise money to honor Mary Hughes Thompson is doing remarkably well. In the first ten days of our funding drive, $8535 has been raised from 94 people around the world. 

Mary Hughes Thompson died on February 5 at the age of 87. She’d spent the last twenty years of her life heavily involved in justice for Palestine, volunteering five times with the Christian Peacekeeper Team (CPT) and the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) in the occupied West Bank. She was also the co-founder of the Free Gaza movement and on one of the first two boats to sail into Gaza in 2008, one of 44 internationals to visit this enclave by sea in 41 years. 

When asked for specifics on the park, Mona AlFarra, MD, director of Projects in Gaza for MECA replied, “"This playground will be a beautiful place for children of Rafah to play and enjoy and also an act of solidarity where we will keep her memory alive and let the children know about Mary and all the people around the world working for our rights."

Dr. Mona added,"Mary loved the Palestinian people and supported our rights. She was one of the people who helped break the siege on Gaza with the Free Gaza movement. When she came to Gaza by ship, she brought with her gifts for children and made strong connections to women and children in Gaza. She touched our hearts. Even at the end of her life, Mary was thinking of what she can do for Palestine.”
