<p>6th of April 2009 at 7am: Israeli Naval forces have abducted eight Palestinian fishermen (including two minors) from the Salateen area in north of the Gaza Strip. Additionally, the fishermen's four hassakas (small fishing boats) have been taken by the Israeli Navy. According to eyewitnesses, the fishermen were only about 100 meters from the coast at the time of their abduction.</p>

<p>Initial information received regarding the fishermen's details are as follows:<br />- Esshaq Mohammed Zayed, 45<br />- Rassam Mohammed Zayed, 25<br />- Hafez Assad Al Sultan, 25<br />- Ahmed Assad Al Sultan, 17<br />- Safwat Zayed Zayed, 35<br />- Nashaat Zayed Zayed, 10<br />- Hammada Joma Zayed, 22<br />- Joma Mollok Zayed, 50</p>
<p>During the last month the Israeli Navy has escalated its attacks against Gazan fishermen by injuring at least three of them, abducting a further 24 fishermen, and stealing 10 hassakas and one shansula fishing boat.</p>
<p>Last week dozens of Salateen fishermen, joined by the Director of the General Syndicate of Marine Fishers, Palestinian activists from the Beit Hanoun Local Initiative and International Solidarity Movement activists, demonstrated against the Israeli attacks, demanding the release of the stolen boats.</p>
