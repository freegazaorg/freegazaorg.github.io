Dear Everyone,<br /><br />The boats have NOT yet been given permission to leave Cyprus. We're all pretty exhausted here, but we're optimistic that things can be resolved. Vaggelis is flying to Cyprus this evening, and he -- and the rest of FG Greece -- have been working tirelessly these last couple of days. There does seem to be movement on the issue.<br /><br />It's possible, but not likely, that we'll be given permission to leave tomorrow (Saturday). More likely, I think we'll probably be able to go on either Monday or Tuesday. We're going to lose some of our passengers, but most will stay - and there are plenty of folks out there still wanting to come &amp; get on the boats.<br /><br />I know all this is frustrating, and I know we haven't been updating everyone very well. I'm sorry. We're doing what we can...<br /><br />Yours,<br />Ramzi
