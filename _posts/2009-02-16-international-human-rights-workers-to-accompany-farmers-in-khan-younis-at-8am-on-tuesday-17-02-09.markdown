<p> For Immediate Release - 8am, Tuesday 17th February 2009: Nine International Human Rights Workers will be accompanying Palestinian farmers in Al Faraheen village, east of Khan Younis. Farmers and international accompaniers were fired upon by Israeli Forces in the same area on February 12th.</p>

 International Human Rights Activists will accompany Yusef Abu Shaheen,<br />a Palestinian farmer, in Abassan Jedida of Al Faraheen village.<br />Shaheen's land is approximately 500 metres from the 'Green Line' and 5<br />kilometres south of Kissufim (Al Qarara) Crossing.
<p>"We are accompanying these farmers to harvest their crops because they<br />have a right to their land. Palestinians who live or have land within<br />1 kilometre of the Green Line are being driven out by Israeli military<br />violence. We consider this to be a form of ethnic cleansing. With<br />international accompaniment, these farmers are able to harvest their<br />crops with a much greater degree of safety than if they were to come<br />to these areas alone" Andrew Muncie (Scotland) - International Human<br />Rights Worker</p>
<p>This action comes after farm worker Anwan was shot and killed by<br />Israeli forces as he worked his land close to the 'Green Line'.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 27th January 2009, in Al Faraheen, Israeli forces shot at<br />several farmers, killing one.</p>
<p>27 year old Anwan was working picking parsley and spinach in the<br />village agricultural lands, approximately 700 m from the Green Line,<br />when Israeli jeeps opened fire with machine guns from behind the Green<br />Line - shooting more than 30 bullets in quick succession,<br />eyewitnesses reported. Many of the seven farmers working in the area<br />scattered, taking shelter from the shower of bullets. Anwan, however,<br />was shot in the neck, dying instantly.</p>
<p>Interviews with volunteers are possible.</p>
