<p><em>New York, NY-May 31, 201l</em>. Organizers of the <a href="http://imeu.createsend2.com/t/r/l/jdtytdl/pjthhdiz/y/" target="_blank">U.S. Boat to Gaza</a> announced today that they expect some 50 people will be aboard <a href="http://imeu.createsend2.com/t/r/l/jdtytdl/pjthhdiz/j/" target="_blank">The Audacity of Hope</a> when it joins the second "freedom flotilla" in late June to break the siege of Gaza.</p>
<p>The  announcement came on the year's anniversary of the 2010 Israeli attack  on unarmed passengers aboard the Mavi Marmara, killing nine, including  an 18-year old U.S. citizen of Turkish descent.</p>
<p>Leslie Cagan,  coordinator of the U.S. Boat to Gaza, said, "We are sailing-despite  threats by the Israeli armed forces to use attack dogs and snipers  against us-and despite frantic diplomatic pressure by the Israeli  government to prevent other countries from allowing the flotilla to  sail." She commented that while Egypt has just opened the Rafah border  to Gaza, the maritime blockade and the Israeli siege of Gaza still  exist.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="http://imeu.createsend2.com/t/r/l/jdtytdl/pjthhdiz/t/" target="_blank">34 passengers and four crewmembers</a> have  confirmed that they will be sailing on The Audacity of Hope. They range  in age from 22 to 87 years old and live in 14 states in every region of  the U.S. All are committed to non-violence. Members of the press will  also be on the boat.</p>
<p>Varied occupations are represented by the  passengers, including retired film producer, construction worker,  retired teacher and engineer, student, author, nurse, EMT, firefighter,  activist, jazz musician, retired military personnel, professor social  worker and lawyer. More than half the participants are women.</p>
<p>Passengers  and crew will gather in Athens on June 21, 2011 in advance of the  anticipated sailing date, which will depend on weather conditions and  logistics.</p>
<p>The Audacity of Hope will carry as its cargo <a href="http://imeu.createsend2.com/t/r/l/jdtytdl/pjthhdiz/i/" target="_blank">thousands of letters of friendship and solidarity</a> with  the people of Gaza from people throughout our country. Cagan said that  inspections of the boat and its passengers prior to departure will prove  the non-violent nature of the mission.</p>
<p>Richard Levy, attorney and  passenger on The Audacity of Hope, explained that "Because Israel  occupies Gaza, and accordingly has obligations under the Geneva  Conventions, it cannot legally blockade Gaza." Therefore, he continued,  "attempts by the Israeli government to prevent ships from going to Gaza  are equally illegal."</p>
<p>A list of confirmed passengers and crew is attached. Short biographical statements from each of them can be found at <a href="http://ustogaza.org/passengers-on-the-audacity-of-hope/" target="_blank">http://ustogaza.org/<wbr></wbr>passengers-on-the-audacity-of-<wbr></wbr>hope/</a></p>
