<p style="font-family: geneva,arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #222222;">February 12, 2011</span></p>
<p style="font-family: geneva,arial,sans-serif;"><span style="color: #222222;">(Manama) – Radhika Sainath  and Huwaida Arraf, chair of the Free Gaza movement, were arrested yesterday while filming police repression of  a peaceful demonstration in Manama, have been deported by the Bahraini  government. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: geneva,arial,sans-serif;"><span style="color: #222222;">At approximately 10:00 am on Sunday, February 12, Ms Sainath and Ms Arraf were put on a plane for New York  via London, less than fifteen hours after being taken into custody by  Bahraini riot police.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: geneva,arial,sans-serif;"><span style="color: #222222;">The two women, both US  citizens, were arrested on Saturday during a peaceful protest near the  Standard Chartered Bank in downtown Manama. Protesters had marched into  the city center to assert a presence of nonviolent, peaceful protest  leading up to the 1-year anniversary of the Arab Spring movement in  Bahrain for equality and democracy.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: geneva,arial,sans-serif;"><span style="color: #222222;">Both were charged with being  present at a gathering of “more than five people with intent to riot,”  illegal assembly and engaging in “acts other than tourist acts” while on  a tourist visa.  Their cameras and computers were confiscated and  searched, and police photographed personal information including credit  cards and journals.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: geneva,arial,sans-serif;"><span style="color: #222222;">As the February 14  anniversary approaches, Bahraini authorities have become more aggressive  about excluding journalists, human rights observers and other  internationals from the country, leading many to fear a brutal  crackdown.  Radhika and Huwaida are a part of the Witness Bahrain  initiative (<a href="http://www.witnessbahrain.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #2559c3;">www.witnessbahrain.org</span></a>), which arrived in Bahrain in response to a call by Bahraini democracy activists for international observers.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: geneva,arial,sans-serif;"><span style="color: #222222;">Yesterday, the Bahraini  government also blocked access to the website of Witness Bahrain and  announced that other members of the group were being sought by police so  they could be deported as well.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: geneva,arial,sans-serif;">Radhika and Huwaida will be available for interviews in the coming week to discuss what they witnessed in Bahrain.</p>
<p style="font-family: geneva,arial,sans-serif;">Witness Bahrain includes activists from Iowa, Northern  California (Sonoma County), San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago,  Minneapolis, Western Massachusetts, and Richmond, Virginia.</p>
