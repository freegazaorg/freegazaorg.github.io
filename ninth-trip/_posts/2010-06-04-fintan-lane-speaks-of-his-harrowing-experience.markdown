<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">Speaking from a hotel room in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">Istanbul</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">, Dr Lane gave an update on the status of the Irish passengers who had been kidnapped by </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">Israel</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE"> on Monday. </span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">Dr Lane said</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">: “I am currently in a hotel with Fiachra O Luian, both of us arrived here late last night. Fiachra was beaten up at the airport and has to go into hospital today for tests. Al Mahdi Al Harati suffered a diabetes related seizure on the plane and this, coming on top of a severe attack he received on board the Mavi Marmara, meant he had to be brought to hospital in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">Ankara</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE"> last night.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE"> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">Dr Lane continued</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">: “Ken O’Keefe, the Irish-American passenger, suffered a severe beating at the hands of security officials at Tel Aviv airport before boarding, and his injuries were so bad that he had to be hospitalised in Tel Aviv – the Israelis are claiming this delay in his repatriation is for ‘technical reasons’, yet another Israeli lie. Finally, a number of passengers are still unaccounted for, among them the Libyan-Irishman Isam Bin Ali, who was due to be deported at </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">10am</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE"> yesterday. No one I’ve spoken to knows where these people are, it is very worrying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE"> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">Dr Lane</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE"> also spoke about the Israeli attack and hijacking of his ship, and his time is captivity. He said: “When they boarded our boat, we resisted entirely peacefully. I sat on the floor and tried to reason with them, but the Israeli commandos physically attacked us. Fiachra was dragged around the ground and I had a gun pointed in my face by a screaming commando. His mania was so intense that I genuinely feared for my life. Others received beatings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">“When they finally took over our ship, and forced us to dock in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">Ashdod</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">, we refused to disembark. We sat down, linked arms and said that we had been illegally kidnapped and brought against our will to </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">Israel</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">. We were all forcibly removed from the boat and brought to interrogation rooms in the port. At this point, I refused to hand over my passport, restating my position that I would not cooperate with my illegal detention and was under no obligation to do so. I was then physically assaulted, my arms were painfully twisted behind my back for prolonged periods and my passport taken.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-IE">“We were then transferred to the prison in Be’er Shevva – though were told we were in Tel Aviv by our captors – and held incommunicado until it was announced that we were all to be deported. It was only at that time that we finally met with the Irish Ambassador.”<br /><br />”In prison I was told about events on the Mavi Marmara, people being shot, left to bleed to death, <span> </span>beaten and bitten by dogs. By all accounts it sounded like it was hell on that boat.”</span></p>
