WEBINAR: Free Gaza Movement: Breaking the Israeli Naval Blockade of Gaza--Organizing the first Boats to Gaza
In May 2020 the Gaza Freedom Flotilla Coalition is sponsoring a series of webinars to commemorate those killed on the 2010 Gaza Freedom flotilla and the thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel that have been killed by the Israeli military and the inhumane policies of the Israeli government. 
May 31, 2020 is the 10th anniversary of the deadly Israel military attack on six civilian boats that were sailing to bring international attention to the plight of the 2 million Palestinians living under a brutal Israeli land, sea and air blockade of Gaza.  Israeli commandos murdered ten and wounded fifty unarmed civilians on the Mavi Marmara ship and beat up passengers on the other five boats.

Over the past 12 years, in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2018, international solidarity activists have sailed 18 voyages with over 30 boats to break the illegal Israeli naval blockade of Gaza.  The next flotilla has been postponed due to COVID19. It is coordinated by the Gaza Freedom Flotilla Coalition which is sponsoring this webinar series.
 
The idea of sailing to break the Israeli naval blockade began in 2008 with a group called Free Gaza Movement.  Their story of the challenges of actually getting boats into Gaza, the first boats in 41 years to arrive in the Gaza City port, the only port Gaza has, is remarkable.
 
Join us on Saturday, May 9, (10 am PDT, 12h00pm CDT , 13h00 EDT, 18h00 UK, 19h00 CEST and 20h00 Greece/Gaza) 
to hear from the four founding members of the Free Gaza Movement, Greta Berlin, Paul Larudee, Mary Hughes-Thompson, Vangelis Pissias, and Musheir El Farra about the challenges of fundraising and organizing the first two boats to reach the shores of Gaza and see photos of the outpouring of goodwill from Gazans as the boats arrived in Gaza in August, 2008.  We will show the trailer of a new movie “Rock the Boat” of the 2008 flotilla by directed by Kathy Sheetz.

The Free Gaza Movement organized 5 voyages to Gaza in 2008 and two voyages in 2009 and the first Freedom Flotilla in 2010.

This screening is presented by Freedom Flotilla Coalition and the Free Gaza Movement and co-hosted by US Boats to Gaza, and Canadian Boat to Gaza.
