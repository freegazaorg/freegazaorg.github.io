As we get ready to sail, once again, to the embattled shores of Gaza, we count on volunteers around the world to get the message out. Since we are a totally volunteer movement, and no one is paid to work with Free Gaza, the great majority of our donations go for boat projects. 

### Free Gaza Affiliates

The Free Gaza Movement has volunteers all across the world, available
for media interviews and local coordination. In order to expand
outreach, help spread information about our efforts, and get as many
people as possible involved within their localities, the Free Gaza
Movement encourages the establishment of local FG affiliates everywhere
in the world. If you're interested in volunteering for Free Gaza or in
starting a Free Gaza affiliate in your area, please review our Points of
Unity and Affiliate Guidelines. If you agree with both policies, then
please contact one of our international coordinators for more
information.
