Quotes

"Gandhi’s and King’s successors in the twenty-first century have carried out further experiments in the power of nonviolent truth to achieve justice and peace in every corner of the world—including, in the last two months, Gaza.  The Free Gaza Movement has succeeded in breaking the siege of Gaza by nonviolent direct action.  After sailing from Cypress, 44 activists from 17 countries landed their two small wooden boats at Gaza Port on August 23, 2008, where a beleaguered people welcomed them.  This nonviolent initiative allowed Palestinians to enter and leave their own country freely for the first time in over 60 years. As Richard Falk, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories noted, it is now a question of whether the courage and commitment of the Free Gaza Movement 'can awaken the conscience of humanity to an unfolding tragedy'. From the groundbreaking work of Gandhi and King to the ongoing example of the Free Gaza Movement, we can discern the transforming power of nonviolence at a crossroads in our history."
H.E. Mr. Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, President of the 63rd Session of the UN General Assembly, in: "Remarks to commemorate the Second International Day of Nonviolence", Oct. 2, 2008,

"Please accept my support for your forthcoming peace boat journey to break the Siege of Gaza. You carry with you the hopes and wishes of many people around the world." 
Mairead Maguire, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate

"Peace and security, we discovered in South Africa, do not come through the barrel of a gun...I support the boat convoy in its attempt."
Desmond Tutu, Archbishop Emeritus

"A courageous and necessary endeavor"
Noam Chomsky

“The homes of people in Gaza must no longer be their prisons. I hope your boat journey will help show the world why the siege of Gaza must be ended and why we must all redouble our efforts to achieve the just peace which Israelis and Palestinians deserve.”
Richard Burden, MP Labour (UK)

"Gandhi once said, 'A few people with the courage of their convictions can become perfect nuisances of the whole State.' Blessed be the nuisances of the Free Gaza movement."
Norman G. Finkelstein
