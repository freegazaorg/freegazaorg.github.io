After having finally got the Arabic alphabet figured out, she is returning for several months volunteering. Originally fitting music teaching around environmental and human rights campaigning, much time spent in Palestine led her to learn basic medic skills, and next year she will take up a midwifery degree in the UK.<p><a href=""></a></p>
