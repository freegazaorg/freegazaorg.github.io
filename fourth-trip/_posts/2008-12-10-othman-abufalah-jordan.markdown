<img src="http://www.freegaza.org/uploads/passengers/" width="75" />Othman is a reporter with Al-Jazeera Television. I\'m a Palestinian refugee born in exile. I know what it means to not be in your homeland, and since I have been working for Al Jazeera, I feel very close to the Palestinian issue. Hopefully in my visit to Gaza, I can show, in part, the suffering of the Palestinian people and move the conscience of the international community.<p><a href=""></a></p>
