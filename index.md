We are a human rights group that, since August 2008,
has sailed nine times to Gaza to break Israel's illegal stranglehold on 1.6 million Palestinian civilians.
We entered Gaza successfully five times in 2008; however,
we have been violently intercepted on four voyages, including Israel's MAY 31, 2010
lethal attack on our Freedom Flotilla when ten of our colleagues were killed and
many more injured by Israeli commandos.

On the tenth voyage in July 2011, Greece prevented us from leaving, as Israel and the U.S. outsourced
Israel's occupation of Gaza to Greece.

We sail as an expression of popular nonviolent, direct action,
confronting Israel's ongoing abuses of Palestinian human and political rights and will continue
to challenge Israel's illegal siege on Gaza
by participating and supporting other initiatives to break the blockade of Gaza by sea.
