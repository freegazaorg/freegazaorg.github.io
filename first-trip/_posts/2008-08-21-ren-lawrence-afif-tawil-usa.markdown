His father Afif George Tawil was born and raised in Jerusalem, Palestine but was visiting the US in May of 1948 and as a result could not freely return and became a \'displaced person\'. He first became aware of the politics surrounding the \'Palestinian Problem\' after the June War of 1967 as an 8th grader, and has maintained an interest ever since.<p><a href=""></a></p><p>Phone:</p>
