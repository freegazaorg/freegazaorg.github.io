## How to login to the editing dashboard on prose.io

* go to <http://prose.io>
* Just to be safe, click on your AdBlock if you have one and disable it for prose.io
* Click "Authorize on Github"
* Login with your "freegazamovement" credentials.
* Click on the right on "freegazaorg".
* Click on the center "freegazaorg.github.io"

## How to create a new post

* click on the "_posts" folder
* click on the green "New file" button
* change the filename to the title of your article (NO SPACES, KEEP
THE DATESTAMP), for example: `_posts/2018-06-13-first-episode-of-2018-trip-to-gaza.md`, make sure the filename starts with `_posts/`, has today's date, no spaces and ends with `.md`.
* Start writing the full length title in the text field below
* Write the content of the post
* read instructions in the (?) button if you need help with formatting
* save with the diskette icon on the top right

After editing it is going to take 5/10 minutes to go live on the website,
you can also check its status looking at:

* <https://github.com/freegazaorg/freegazaorg.github.io/commits/master>

Here a yellow dot means that that version is being built, a green tick means built was successful, if there is
a red mark, contact the admin.

## How to add images

The system is a little buggy for images, it should work on Chrome.

* Open the post you want to add an image to
* First save any other change you made to the text with the diskette icon
* Now drag and drop the image into the page (images should be below 500KB)
* Now the page freezes, but it should be uploading it
* Wait 5 seconds for the upload to complete, then click RELOAD (F5), even if
a warning pops up, go ahead
* You should find that this was added to the page: `[](/images/yourimage.jpg)`
* Save the post again with the diskette button

## How to edit website static pages

A "static page" is any page on the website that is not a news item or a post,
for example "index.md" is the
homepage.

Just scroll down on `prose.io` and click to edit, then click "Save" button on the right when
you are done.

## How to edit old posts

* click on the "_posts" folder to get to the list of all website news items
* filter them by writing partially the title
* click to edit, do not modify the top header
