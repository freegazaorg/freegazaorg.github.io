title: Invites to Gaza
---

The Free Gaza Movement seeks to work with as broad a spectrum of the
Palestinian society in Gaza as possible, and is happy to cooperate with
all non-partisan groups that wish to receive and welcome us and to
participate in the planning of our visit.

These currently include the International Campaign to End the Siege on
Gaza, the Palestinian Medical Relief Society, the Popular Committee
Against the Siege, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, and the Gaza
Community Mental Health Programme.

We therefore welcome all other groups that wish to participate, and
encourage them to coordinate their plans with each other and with us. Our
objective is to be in solidarity with all the people of Palestine.
