In February 2007, Rossi and Franco Turigliatto were the two representatives from The Union coalition who abstained from a key vote on the foreign policy position outlined by Massimo D\'Alema, Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs bringing down the government of Romano Prodi, over whether Italy should continue to provide troops to Afghanistan and Mr. Prodi\'s support of an expansion of an American military base in Vicenza, in northern Italy.<br />With only a razor-thin majority, the abstentions killed the measure, aimed at gaining Senate support for Italy\'s foreign policy, and unexpectedly, doomed the government.<br />&quot;I can\'t in any way give my vote to this government with this foreign policy,&quot; said Fernando Rossi<br />Following this, he joined the United Consumers group, and later founded his own.<br /><p><a href=""></a></p>
