<img src="http://www.freegaza.org/uploads/passengers/" width="75" />Captain. Denis has been involved with boats for 45 years beginning with small fishing boats in Portsmouth. He learned to sail while at school and has been part of the sea ever since. He\'s a certified yacht master and has also worked on heavy marine equipment from yachts to large dredgers. This is his second of many trips (he hopes) to Gaza.<p><a href=""></a></p>
